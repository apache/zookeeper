A value of 0.0 disables the rule. A value of 0.5 still implies a code health hit but only at 50% of the default impact. Note that you can specify multiple rule sets and use the matching-content-path to control to which parts or languages the rules apply. This makes it possible to differentiate between test vs application code, or tailor rules to specific languages.",
