/**
 * Instances of this class can be used to watch a directory for file changes. When a file is added to, deleted from,
 * or is modified in the given directory, the callback provided by the user will be called from a background thread.
 * Some things to keep in mind:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The callback should be thread-safe.</li>
 * <li>Changes that happen around the time the thread is started may be missed.</li>
 * <li>There is a delay between a file changing and the callback firing.</li>
 * <li>The watch is not recursive - changes to subdirectories will not trigger a callback.</li>
 * </ul>
