/**
 * When enabled, the RequestThrottler limits the number of outstanding requests
 * currently submitted to the request processor pipeline. The throttler augments
 * the limit imposed by the <code>globalOutstandingLimit</code> that is enforced
 * by the connection layer ({@link NIOServerCnxn}, {@link NettyServerCnxn}).
 *
 * The connection layer limit applies backpressure against the TCP connection by
 * disabling selection on connections once the request limit is reached. However,
 * the connection layer always allows a connection to send at least one request
 * before disabling selection on that connection. Thus, in a scenario with 40000
 * client connections, the total number of requests inflight may be as high as
 * 40000 even if the <code>globalOustandingLimit</code> was set lower.
 *
 * The RequestThrottler addresses this issue by adding additional queueing. When
 * enabled, client connections no longer submit requests directly to the request
 * processor pipeline but instead to the RequestThrottler. The RequestThrottler
 * is then responsible for issuing requests to the request processors, and
 * enforces a separate <code>maxRequests</code> limit. If the total number of
 * outstanding requests is higher than <code>maxRequests</code>, the throttler
 * will continually stall for <code>stallTime</code> milliseconds until
 * underlimit.
 *
 * The RequestThrottler can also optionally drop stale requests rather than
 * submit them to the processor pipeline. A stale request is a request sent
 * by a connection that is already closed, and/or a request whose latency
 * will end up being higher than its associated session timeout. The notion
 * of staleness is configurable, @see Request for more details.
 *
 * To ensure ordering guarantees, if a request is ever dropped from a connection
 * that connection is closed and flagged as invalid. All subsequent requests
 * inflight from that connection are then dropped as well.
