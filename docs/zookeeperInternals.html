<a name="N10022"></a><a name="sc_atomicBroadcast"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Atomic Broadcast</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
At the heart of ZooKeeper is an atomic messaging system that keeps all of the servers in sync.</p>
<a name="N1002B"></a><a name="sc_guaranteesPropertiesDefinitions"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Guarantees, Properties, and Definitions</h3>
<p>
The specific guarantees provided by the messaging system used by ZooKeeper are the following:</p>
<dl>


<dt>
<term>
<em>Reliable delivery</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a message, m, is delivered 
by one server, it will be eventually delivered by all servers.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<term>
<em>Total order</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p> If a message is 
delivered before message b by one server, a will be delivered before b by all 
servers. If a and b are delivered messages, either a will be delivered before b 
or b will be delivered before a.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<term>
<em>Causal order</em> 
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If a message b is sent after a message a has been delivered by the sender of b, 
a must be ordered before b. If a sender sends c after sending b, c must be ordered after b.
</p>
</dd>


</dl>
<p>
The ZooKeeper messaging system also needs to be efficient, reliable, and easy to 
implement and maintain. We make heavy use of messaging, so we need the system to 
be able to handle thousands of requests per second. Although we can require at 
least k+1 correct servers to send new messages, we must be able to recover from 
correlated failures such as power outages. When we implemented the system we had 
little time and few engineering resources, so we needed a protocol that is 
accessible to engineers and is easy to implement. We found that our protocol 
satisfied all of these goals.

</p>
<p>
Our protocol assumes that we can construct point-to-point FIFO channels between 
the servers. While similar services usually assume message delivery that can 
lose or reorder messages, our assumption of FIFO channels is very practical 
given that we use TCP for communication. Specifically we rely on the following property of TCP:</p>
<dl>


<dt>
<term>
<em>Ordered delivery</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Data is delivered in the same order it is sent and a message m is 
delivered only after all messages sent before m have been delivered. 
(The corollary to this is that if message m is lost all messages after m will be lost.)</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<term>
<em>No message after close</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once a FIFO channel is closed, no messages will be received from it.</p>
</dd>


</dl>
<p>
FLP proved that consensus cannot be achieved in asynchronous distributed systems 
if failures are possible. To ensure we achieve consensus in the presence of failures 
we use timeouts. However, we rely on times for liveness not for correctness. So, 
if timeouts stop working (clocks malfunction for example) the messaging system may 
hang, but it will not violate its guarantees.</p>
<p>When describing the ZooKeeper messaging protocol we will talk of packets, 
proposals, and messages:</p>
<dl>

<dt>
<term>
<em>Packet</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>a sequence of bytes sent through a FIFO channel</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<term>
<em>Proposal</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>a unit of agreement. Proposals are agreed upon by exchanging packets 
with a quorum of ZooKeeper servers. Most proposals contain messages, however the 
NEW_LEADER proposal is an example of a proposal that does not correspond to a message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<term>
<em>Message</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>a sequence of bytes to be atomically broadcast to all ZooKeeper 
servers. A message put into a proposal and agreed upon before it is delivered.</p>
</dd>


</dl>
<p>
As stated above, ZooKeeper guarantees a total order of messages, and it also 
guarantees a total order of proposals. ZooKeeper exposes the total ordering using
a ZooKeeper transaction id (<em>zxid</em>). All proposals will be stamped with a zxid when 
it is proposed and exactly reflects the total ordering. Proposals are sent to all 
ZooKeeper servers and committed when a quorum of them acknowledge the proposal. 
If a proposal contains a message, the message will be delivered when the proposal 
is committed. Acknowledgement means the server has recorded the proposal to persistent storage. 
Our quorums have the requirement that any pair of quorum must have at least one server 
in common. We ensure this by requiring that all quorums have size (<em>n/2+1</em>) where 
n is the number of servers that make up a ZooKeeper service.
</p>
<p>
The zxid has two parts: the epoch and a counter. In our implementation the zxid 
is a 64-bit number. We use the high order 32-bits for the epoch and the low order 
32-bits for the counter. Because it has two parts represent the zxid both as a 
number and as a pair of integers, (<em>epoch, count</em>). The epoch number represents a 
change in leadership. Each time a new leader comes into power it will have its 
own epoch number. We have a simple algorithm to assign a unique zxid to a proposal: 
the leader simply increments the zxid to obtain a unique zxid for each proposal. 
<em>Leadership activation will ensure that only one leader uses a given epoch, so our 
simple algorithm guarantees that every proposal will have a unique id.</em>

</p>
<p>
ZooKeeper messaging consists of two phases:</p>
<dl>

<dt>
<term>
<em>Leader activation</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this phase a leader establishes the correct state of the system 
and gets ready to start making proposals.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<term>
<em>Active messaging</em>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this phase a leader accepts messages to propose and coordinates message delivery.</p>
</dd>

</dl>
<p>
ZooKeeper is a holistic protocol. We do not focus on individual proposals, rather 
look at the stream of proposals as a whole. Our strict ordering allows us to do this 
efficiently and greatly simplifies our protocol. Leadership activation embodies 
this holistic concept. A leader becomes active only when a quorum of followers 
(The leader counts as a follower as well. You can always vote for yourself ) has synced 
up with the leader, they have the same state. This state consists of all of the 
proposals that the leader believes have been committed and the proposal to follow 
the leader, the NEW_LEADER proposal. (Hopefully you are thinking to 
yourself, <em>Does the set of proposals that the leader believes has been committed 
included all the proposals that really have been committed?</em> The answer is <em>yes</em>. 
Below, we make clear why.)
</p>
<a name="N100B9"></a><a name="sc_leaderElection"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Leader Activation</h3>
<p>
Leader activation includes leader election. We currently have two leader election 
algorithms in ZooKeeper: LeaderElection and FastLeaderElection (AuthFastLeaderElection 
is a variant of FastLeaderElection that uses UDP and allows servers to perform a simple
form of authentication to avoid IP spoofing). ZooKeeper messaging doesn't care about the 
exact method of electing a leader has long as the following holds:
</p>
<ul>


<li>
<p>The leader has seen the highest zxid of all the followers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A quorum of servers have committed to following the leader.</p>
</li>


</ul>
<p>
Of these two requirements only the first, the highest zxid amoung the followers 
needs to hold for correct operation. The second requirement, a quorum of followers, 
just needs to hold with high probability. We are going to recheck the second requirement, 
so if a failure happens during or after the leader election and quorum is lost, 
we will recover by abandoning leader activation and running another election.
</p>
<p>
After leader election a single server will be designated as a leader and start 
waiting for followers to connect. The rest of the servers will try to connect to 
the leader. The leader will sync up with followers by sending any proposals they 
are missing, or if a follower is missing too many proposals, it will send a full 
snapshot of the state to the follower.
</p>
<p>
There is a corner case in which a follower that has proposals, U, not seen 
by a leader arrives. Proposals are seen in order, so the proposals of U will have a zxids 
higher than zxids seen by the leader. The follower must have arrived after the 
leader election, otherwise the follower would have been elected leader given that 
it has seen a higher zxid. Since committed proposals must be seen by a quorum of 
servers, and a quorum of servers that elected the leader did not see U, the proposals 
of you have not been committed, so they can be discarded. When the follower connects 
to the leader, the leader will tell the follower to discard U.
</p>
<p>
A new leader establishes a zxid to start using for new proposals by getting the 
epoch, e, of the highest zxid it has seen and setting the next zxid to use to be 
(e+1, 0), fter the leader syncs with a follower, it will propose a NEW_LEADER 
proposal. Once the NEW_LEADER proposal has been committed, the leader will activate 
and start receiving and issuing proposals.
</p>
<p>
It all sounds complicated but here are the basic rules of operation during leader 
activation:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>A follower will ACK the NEW_LEADER proposal after it has synced with the leader.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A follower will only ACK a NEW_LEADER proposal with a given zxid from a single server.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A new leader will COMMIT the NEW_LEADER proposal when a quorum of followers have ACKed it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A follower will commit any state it received from the leader when the NEW_LEADER proposal is COMMIT.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A new leader will not accept new proposals until the NEW_LEADER proposal has been COMMITED.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>
If leader election terminates erroneously, we don't have a problem since the 
NEW_LEADER proposal will not be committed since the leader will not have quorum. 
When this happens, the leader and any remaining followers will timeout and go back 
to leader election.
</p>
<a name="N100F7"></a><a name="sc_activeMessaging"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Active Messaging</h3>
<p>
Leader Activation does all the heavy lifting. Once the leader is coronated he can 
start blasting out proposals. As long as he remains the leader no other leader can 
emerge since no other leader will be able to get a quorum of followers. If a new 
leader does emerge, 
it means that the leader has lost quorum, and the new leader will clean up any 
mess left over during her leadership activation.
</p>
<p>ZooKeeper messaging operates similar to a classic two-phase commit.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/2pc.jpg"><p>
All communication channels are FIFO, so everything is done in order. Specifically 
the following operating constraints are observed:</p>
<ul>


<li>
<p>The leader sends proposals to all followers using 
the same order. Moreover, this order follows the order in which requests have been 
received. Because we use FIFO channels this means that followers also receive proposals in order.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>Followers process messages in the order they are received. This 
means that messages will be ACKed in order and the leader will receive ACKs from 
followers in order, due to the FIFO channels. It also means that if message $m$ 
has been written to non-volatile storage, all messages that were proposed before 
$m$ have been written to non-volatile storage.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>The leader will issue a COMMIT to all followers as soon as a 
quorum of followers have ACKed a message. Since messages are ACKed in order, 
COMMITs will be sent by the leader as received by the followers in order.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>COMMITs are processed in order. Followers deliver a proposals 
message when that proposal is committed.</p>
</li>


</ul>
<a name="N1011E"></a><a name="sc_summary"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Summary</h3>
<p>So there you go. Why does it work? Specifically, why does is set of proposals 
believed by a new leader always contain any proposal that has actually been committed? 
First, all proposals have a unique zxid, so unlike other protocols, we never have 
to worry about two different values being proposed for the same zxid; followers 
(a leader is also a follower) see and record proposals in order; proposals are 
committed in order; there is only one active leader at a time since followers only 
follow a single leader at a time; a new leader has seen all committed proposals 
from the previous epoch since it has seen the highest zxid from a quorum of servers; 
any uncommited proposals from a previous epoch seen by a new leader will be committed 
by that leader before it becomes active.</p>
<a name="N10127"></a><a name="sc_comparisons"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Comparisons</h3>
<p>
Isn't this just Multi-Paxos? No, Multi-Paxos requires some way of assuring that 
there is only a single coordinator. We do not count on such assurances. Instead 
we use the leader activation to recover from leadership change or old leaders 
believing they are still active.
</p>
<p>
Isn't this just Paxos? Your active messaging phase looks just like phase 2 of Paxos? 
Actually, to us active messaging looks just like 2 phase commit without the need to 
handle aborts. Active messaging is different from both in the sense that it has 
cross proposal ordering requirements. If we do not maintain strict FIFO ordering of 
all packets, it all falls apart. Also, our leader activation phase is different from 
both of them. In particular, our use of epochs allows us to skip blocks of uncommitted
proposals and to not worry about duplicate proposals for a given zxid.
</p>
</div>


<a name="N10134"></a><a name="sc_quorum"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Quorums</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Atomic broadcast and leader election use the notion of quorum to guarantee a consistent
view of the system. By default, ZooKeeper uses majority quorums, which means that every
voting that happens in one of these protocols requires a majority to vote on. One example is
acknowledging a leader proposal: the leader can only commit once it receives an
acknowledgement from a quorum of servers.
</p>
<p>
If we extract the properties that we really need from our use of majorities, we have that we only
need to guarantee that groups of processes used to validate an operation by voting (e.g., acknowledging
a leader proposal) pairwise intersect in at least one server. Using majorities guarantees such a property.
However, there are other ways of constructing quorums different from majorities. For example, we can assign
weights to the votes of servers, and say that the votes of some servers are more important. To obtain a quorum,
we get enough votes so that the sum of weights of all votes is larger than half of the total sum of all weights.    
</p>
<p>
A different construction that uses weights and is useful in wide-area deployments (co-locations) is a hierarchical
one. With this construction, we split the servers into disjoint groups and assign weights to processes. To form 
a quorum, we have to get a hold of enough servers from a majority of groups G, such that for each group g in G,
the sum of votes from g is larger than half of the sum of weights in g. Interestingly, this construction enables
smaller quorums. If we have, for example, 9 servers, we split them into 3 groups, and assign a weight of 1 to each
server, then we are able to form quorums of size 4. Note that two subsets of processes composed each of a majority
of servers from each of a majority of groups necessarily have a non-empty intersection. It is reasonable to expect
that a majority of co-locations will have a majority of servers available with high probability. 
</p>
<p>
With ZooKeeper, we provide a user with the ability of configuring servers to use majority quorums, weights, or a 
hierarchy of groups.

<a name="N10147"></a><a name="sc_logging"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Logging</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
ZooKeeper uses 
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a>
version 1.2 as its logging infrastructure. For information on configuring log4j for
ZooKeeper, see the <a href="zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_logging">Logging</a> section

</p>
<a name="N1015C"></a><a name="sc_developerGuidelines"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Developer Guidelines</h3>
<p>Please follow these guidelines when submitting code. Patch reviewers will look for the following:</p>
<a name="N10164"></a><a name="sc_rightLevel"></a>
<h4>Logging at the Right Level</h4>
<p>
There are <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/Level.html#FATAL">6 levels of logging in log4j</a>. 
It's important to pick the right one. In order of higher to lower severity:</p>
<ol>
   
<li>
<p> FATAL level designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort</p>
</li>
   
<li>
<p>ERROR level designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.</p>
</li>
   
<li>
<p>WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.</p>
</li>
   
<li>
<p>INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.</p>
</li>
   
<li>
<p>EBUG Level designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.</p>
</li>
   
<li>
<p>TRACE Level designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>
ZooKeeper is typically run in production such that log messages of INFO level 
severity and higher (more severe) are output to the log.</p>

<h4>Use of Standard log4j Idioms</h4>
<p>
<em>Static Message Logging</em>
</p>
<pre class="code">
LOG.debug("process completed successfully!");
</pre>
<p>However when creating a message from a number of components (string 
concatenation), the log call should be wrapped with a "isXEnabled()" call. this 
eliminates the string concatenation overhead when debug level logging is not enabled.
</p>
<pre class="code">
if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
    LOG.debug("got " + count + " messages in " + time + " minutes");
}
</pre>
<p>
<em>Naming</em>
</p>
<p>
Loggers should be named after the class in which they are used. (See the 
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#2.4">log4j faq</a> 
for reasons why this is a good idea.)
</p>
<pre class="code">
public class Foo {
    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(Foo.class);
    ....
    public Foo() {
       LOG.info("constructing Foo");
</pre>
<p>
<em>Exception handling</em>
</p>
<pre class="code">
try {
  // code
} catch (XYZException e) {
  // do this
  LOG.error("Something bad happened", e);
  // don't do this (generally)
  // LOG.error(e);
  // why? because "don't do" case hides the stack trace
 
  // continue process here as you need... recover or (re)throw
}
</pre>
