<h2 class="h3">Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Prior to the 3.5.0 release, the membership and all other configuration
      parameters of Zookeeper were static - loaded during boot and immutable at
      runtime. Operators resorted to ''rolling restarts'' - a manually intensive
      and error-prone method of changing the configuration that has caused data
      loss and inconsistency in production.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.5.0, &ldquo;rolling restarts&rdquo; are no longer needed!
      ZooKeeper comes with full support for automated configuration changes: the
      set of Zookeeper servers, their roles (participant / observer), all ports,
      and even the quorum system can be changed dynamically, without service
      interruption and while maintaining data consistency. Reconfigurations are
      performed immediately, just like other operations in ZooKeeper. Multiple
      changes can be done using a single reconfiguration command. The dynamic
      reconfiguration functionality does not limit operation concurrency, does
      not require client operations to be stopped during reconfigurations, has a
      very simple interface for administrators and no added complexity to other
      client operations.</p>
<p>New client-side features allow clients to find out about configuration
      changes and to update the connection string (list of servers and their
      client ports) stored in their ZooKeeper handle. A probabilistic algorithm
      is used to rebalance clients across the new configuration servers while
      keeping the extent of client migrations proportional to the change in
      ensemble membership.</p>
<p>This document provides the administrator manual for reconfiguration.
      For a detailed description of the reconfiguration algorithms, performance
      measurements, and more, please see our paper:</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="sc_reconfig_clientport"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Specifying the client port</h3>
<p>A client port of a server is the port on which the server accepts
        client connection requests. Starting with 3.5.0 the
        <em>clientPort</em> and <em>clientPortAddress
        </em> configuration parameters should no longer be used. Instead,
        this information is now part of the server keyword specification, which
        becomes as follows:</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">server.&lt;positive id&gt; = &lt;address1&gt;:&lt;port1&gt;:&lt;port2&gt;[:role];[&lt;client port address&gt;:]&lt;client port&gt;</span>
</p>
<p>The client port specification is to the right of the semicolon. The
        client port address is optional, and if not specified it defaults to
        "0.0.0.0". As usual, role is also optional, it can be
        <em>participant</em> or <em>observer</em>
        (<em>participant</em> by default).</p>
<p> Examples of legal server statements: </p>
<ul>
        
<li>
          
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">server.5 = 125.23.63.23:1234:1235;1236</span>
</p>
        
</li>
        
<li>
          
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">server.5 = 125.23.63.23:1234:1235:participant;1236</span>
</p>
        
</li>
        
<li>
          
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">server.5 = 125.23.63.23:1234:1235:observer;1236</span>
</p>
        
</li>
        
<li>
          
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">server.5 = 125.23.63.23:1234:1235;125.23.63.24:1236</span>
</p>
        
</li>
        
<li>
          
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">server.5 = 125.23.63.23:1234:1235:participant;125.23.63.23:1236</span>
</p>
        
</li>
      
</ul>
<a name="sc_reconfig_standaloneEnabled"></a>
<h3 class="h4">The standaloneEnabled flag</h3>
<p>Prior to 3.5.0, one could run ZooKeeper in Standalone mode or in a
        Distributed mode. These are separate implementation stacks, and
        switching between them during run time is not possible. By default (for
        backward compatibility) <em>standaloneEnabled</em> is set to
        <em>true</em>. The consequence of using this default is that
        if started with a single server the ensemble will not be allowed to
        grow, and if started with more than one server it will not be allowed to
        shrink to contain fewer than two participants.</p>
<p>Setting the flag to <em>false</em> instructs the system
        to run the Distributed software stack even if there is only a single
        participant in the ensemble. To achieve this the (static) configuration
        file should contain:</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">standaloneEnabled=false</span>
</p>
<p>With this setting it is possible to start a ZooKeeper ensemble
        containing a single participant and to dynamically grow it by adding
        more servers. Similarly, it is possible to shrink an ensemble so that
        just a single participant remains, by removing servers.</p>
<p>Since running the Distributed mode allows more flexibility, we
        recommend setting the flag to <em>false</em>. We expect that
        the legacy Standalone mode will be deprecated in the future.</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_reconfigEnabled"></a>
<h3 class="h4">The reconfigEnabled flag</h3>
<p>Starting with 3.5.0 and prior to 3.5.3, there is no way to disable
        dynamic reconfiguration feature. We would like to offer the option of
        disabling reconfiguration feature because with reconfiguration enabled,
        we have a security concern that a malicious actor can make arbitrary changes
        to the configuration of a ZooKeeper ensemble, including adding a compromised
        server to the ensemble. We prefer to leave to the discretion of the user to
        decide whether to enable it or not and make sure that the appropriate security
        measure are in place. So in 3.5.3 the <a href="zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_advancedConfiguration">
          reconfigEnabled </a> configuration option is introduced
        such that the reconfiguration feature can be completely disabled and any attempts
        to reconfigure a cluster through reconfig API with or without authentication
        will fail by default, unless <strong>reconfigEnabled</strong> is set to
        <strong>true</strong>.
      </p>
<p>To set the option to true, the configuration file (zoo.cfg) should contain:</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag computeroutput">reconfigEnabled=true</span>
</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_file"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Dynamic configuration file</h3>
<p>Starting with 3.5.0 we're distinguishing between dynamic
        configuration parameters, which can be changed during runtime, and
        static configuration parameters, which are read from a configuration
        file when a server boots and don't change during its execution. For now,
        the following configuration keywords are considered part of the dynamic
        configuration: <em>server</em>, <em>group</em>
        and <em>weight</em>.</p>
<p>Dynamic configuration parameters are stored in a separate file on
        the server (which we call the dynamic configuration file). This file is
        linked from the static config file using the new
        <em>dynamicConfigFile</em> keyword.</p>
<p>
<strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<div class="note example">
<div class="label">zoo_replicated1.cfg</div>
<div class="content">
        
<title>zoo_replicated1.cfg</title>
        
<pre class="code">tickTime=2000
dataDir=/zookeeper/data/zookeeper1
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
dynamicConfigFile=/zookeeper/conf/zoo_replicated1.cfg.dynamic</pre>
      
</div>
</div>
<div class="note example">
<div class="label">zoo_replicated1.cfg.dynamic</div>
<div class="content">
        
<title>zoo_replicated1.cfg.dynamic</title>
        
<pre class="code">server.1=125.23.63.23:2780:2783:participant;2791
server.2=125.23.63.24:2781:2784:participant;2792
server.3=125.23.63.25:2782:2785:participant;2793</pre>
      
</div>
</div>
<p>When the ensemble configuration changes, the static configuration
        parameters remain the same. The dynamic parameters are pushed by
        ZooKeeper and overwrite the dynamic configuration files on all servers.
        Thus, the dynamic configuration files on the different servers are
        usually identical (they can only differ momentarily when a
        reconfiguration is in progress, or if a new configuration hasn't
        propagated yet to some of the servers). Once created, the dynamic
        configuration file should not be manually altered. Changed are only made
        through the new reconfiguration commands outlined below. Note that
        changing the config of an offline cluster could result in an
        inconsistency with respect to configuration information stored in the
        ZooKeeper log (and the special configuration znode, populated from the
        log) and is therefore highly discouraged.</p>
<p>
<strong>Example 2</strong>
</p>
<p>Users may prefer to initially specify a single configuration file.
        The following is thus also legal:</p>
<div class="note example">
<div class="label">zoo_replicated1.cfg</div>
<div class="content">
        
<title>zoo_replicated1.cfg</title>
        
<pre class="code">tickTime=2000
dataDir=/zookeeper/data/zookeeper1
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
clientPort=<strong>2791</strong>  // note that this line is now redundant and therefore not recommended
server.1=125.23.63.23:2780:2783:participant;<strong>2791</strong>
server.2=125.23.63.24:2781:2784:participant;2792
server.3=125.23.63.25:2782:2785:participant;2793</pre>
      
</div>
</div>
<p>The configuration files on each server will be automatically split
        into dynamic and static files, if they are not already in this format.
        So the configuration file above will be automatically transformed into
        the two files in Example 1. Note that the clientPort and
        clientPortAddress lines (if specified) will be automatically removed
        during this process, if they are redundant (as in the example above).
        The original static configuration file is backed up (in a .bak
        file).</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_backward"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Backward compatibility</h3>
<p>We still support the old configuration format. For example, the
        following configuration file is acceptable (but not recommended):</p>
<div class="note example">
<div class="label">zoo_replicated1.cfg</div>
<div class="content">
        
<title>zoo_replicated1.cfg</title>
        
<pre class="code">tickTime=2000
dataDir=/zookeeper/data/zookeeper1
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
clientPort=2791
server.1=125.23.63.23:2780:2783:participant
server.2=125.23.63.24:2781:2784:participant
server.3=125.23.63.25:2782:2785:participant</pre>
      
</div>
</div>
<p>During boot, a dynamic configuration file is created and contains
        the dynamic part of the configuration as explained earlier. In this
        case, however, the line "clientPort=2791" will remain in the static
        configuration file of server 1 since it is not redundant -- it was not
        specified as part of the "server.1=..." using the format explained in
        the section <a href="#ch_reconfig_format">Changes to Configuration Format</a>. If a reconfiguration
        is invoked that sets the client port of server 1, we remove
        "clientPort=2791" from the static configuration file (the dynamic file
        now contain this information as part of the specification of server
        1).</p>
</div>
  
<a name="ch_reconfig_upgrade"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Upgrading to 3.5.0</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Upgrading a running ZooKeeper ensemble to 3.5.0 should be done only
      after upgrading your ensemble to the 3.4.6 release. Note that this is only
      necessary for rolling upgrades (if you're fine with shutting down the
      system completely, you don't have to go through 3.4.6). If you attempt a
      rolling upgrade without going through 3.4.6 (for example from 3.4.5), you
      may get the following error:</p>
<pre class="code">2013-01-30 11:32:10,663 [myid:2] - INFO [localhost/127.0.0.1:2784:QuorumCnxManager$Listener@498] - Received connection request /127.0.0.1:60876
2013-01-30 11:32:10,663 [myid:2] - WARN [localhost/127.0.0.1:2784:QuorumCnxManager@349] - Invalid server id: -65536</pre>
<p>During a rolling upgrade, each server is taken down in turn and
      rebooted with the new 3.5.0 binaries. Before starting the server with
      3.5.0 binaries, we highly recommend updating the configuration file so
      that all server statements "server.x=..." contain client ports (see the
      section <a href="#sc_reconfig_clientport">Specifying the client port</a>). As explained earlier
      you may leave the configuration in a single file, as well as leave the
      clientPort/clientPortAddress statements (although if you specify client
      ports in the new format, these statements are now redundant).</p>

<h2 class="h3">Dynamic Reconfiguration of the ZooKeeper Ensemble</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The ZooKeeper Java and C API were extended with getConfig and reconfig
      commands that facilitate reconfiguration. Both commands have a synchronous
      (blocking) variant and an asynchronous one. We demonstrate these commands
      here using the Java CLI, but note that you can similarly use the C CLI or
      invoke the commands directly from a program just like any other ZooKeeper
      command.</p>
<a name="ch_reconfig_api"></a>
<h3 class="h4">API</h3>
<p>There are two sets of APIs for both Java and C client.
      </p>
<dl>

<term>
<strong>Reconfiguration API</strong>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reconfiguration API is used to reconfigure the ZooKeeper cluster.
              Starting with 3.5.3, reconfiguration Java APIs are moved into ZooKeeperAdmin class
              from ZooKeeper class, and use of this API requires ACL setup and user
              authentication (see <a href="#sc_reconfig_access_control">Security</a> for more information.).
            </p>
</dd>

        
<dt>
<term>
<strong>Get Configuration API</strong>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Get configuration APIs are used to retrieve ZooKeeper cluster configuration information
              stored in /zookeeper/config znode. Use of this API does not require specific setup or authentication,
            because /zookeeper/config is readable to any users.</p>
</dd>
      
</dl>
<a name="sc_reconfig_access_control"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Security</h3>
<p>Prior to <strong>3.5.3</strong>, there is no enforced security mechanism
        over reconfig so any ZooKeeper clients that can connect to ZooKeeper server ensemble
        will have the ability to change the state of a ZooKeeper cluster via reconfig.
        It is thus possible for a malicious client to add compromised server to an ensemble,
        e.g., add a compromised server, or remove legitimate servers.
        Cases like these could be security vulnerabilities on a case by case basis.
      </p>
<p>To address this security concern, we introduced access control over reconfig
        starting from <strong>3.5.3</strong> such that only a specific set of users
        can use reconfig commands or APIs, and these users need be configured explicitly. In addition,
        the setup of ZooKeeper cluster must enable authentication so ZooKeeper clients can be authenticated.
      </p>
<p>
        We also provides an escape hatch for users who operate and interact with a ZooKeeper ensemble in a secured
        environment (i.e. behind company firewall). For those users who want to use reconfiguration feature but
        don't want the overhead of configuring an explicit list of authorized user for reconfig access checks,
        they can set <a href="zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_authOptions">"skipACL"</a> to "yes" which will
        skip ACL check and allow any user to reconfigure cluster.
      </p>
<p>
        Overall, ZooKeeper provides flexible configuration options for the reconfigure feature
        that allow a user to choose based on user's security requirement.
        We leave to the discretion of the user to decide appropriate security measure are in place.

<strong>Access Control</strong>
</term>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The dynamic configuration is stored in a special znode
              ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE = /zookeeper/config. This node by default is read only
              for all users, except super user and users that's explicitly configured for write
              access.
            </p>
<p>Clients that need to use reconfig commands or reconfig API should be configured as users
              that have write access to CONFIG_NODE. By default, only the super user has full control including
              write access to CONFIG_NODE. Additional users can be granted write access through superuser
              by setting an ACL that has write permission associated with specified user.
            </p>
<p>A few examples of how to setup ACLs and use reconfiguration API with authentication can be found in
              ReconfigExceptionTest.java and TestReconfigServer.cc.</p>

<strong>Authentication</strong>
</term>

<dd>
<p>Authentication of users is orthogonal to the access control and is delegated to
              existing authentication mechanism supported by ZooKeeper's pluggable authentication schemes.

<strong>Disable ACL check</strong>

              ZooKeeper supports <a href="zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_authOptions">"skipACL"</a> option such that ACL
              check will be completely skipped, if skipACL is set to "yes". In such cases any unauthenticated
              users can use reconfig API.

<h3 class="h4">Retrieving the current dynamic configuration</h3>
<p>The dynamic configuration is stored in a special znode
        ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE = /zookeeper/config. The new
        <span class="codefrag command">config</span> CLI command reads this znode (currently it is
        simply a wrapper to <span class="codefrag command">get /zookeeper/config</span>). As with
        normal reads, to retrieve the latest committed value you should do a
        <span class="codefrag command">sync</span> first.</p>
<pre class="code">[zk: 127.0.0.1:2791(CONNECTED) 3] config
server.1=localhost:2780:2783:participant;localhost:2791
server.2=localhost:2781:2784:participant;localhost:2792
server.3=localhost:2782:2785:participant;localhost:2793
<strong>version=400000003</strong>
</pre>
<p>Notice the last line of the output. This is the configuration
        version. The version equals to the zxid of the reconfiguration command
        which created this configuration. The version of the first established
        configuration equals to the zxid of the NEWLEADER message sent by the
        first successfully established leader. When a configuration is written
        to a dynamic configuration file, the version automatically becomes part
        of the filename and the static configuration file is updated with the
        path to the new dynamic configuration file. Configuration files
        corresponding to earlier versions are retained for backup
        purposes.</p>
<p>During boot time the version (if it exists) is extracted from the
        filename. The version should never be altered manually by users or the
        system administrator. It is used by the system to know which
        configuration is most up-to-date. Manipulating it manually can result in
        data loss and inconsistency.</p>
<p>Just like a <span class="codefrag command">get</span> command, the
        <span class="codefrag command">config</span> CLI command accepts the <span class="codefrag option">-w</span>
        flag for setting a watch on the znode, and <span class="codefrag option">-s</span> flag for
        displaying the Stats of the znode. It additionally accepts a new flag
        <span class="codefrag option">-c</span> which outputs only the version and the client
        connection string corresponding to the current configuration. For
        example, for the configuration above we would get:</p>
<pre class="code">[zk: 127.0.0.1:2791(CONNECTED) 17] config -c
400000003 localhost:2791,localhost:2793,localhost:2792</pre>
<p>Note that when using the API directly, this command is called
        <span class="codefrag command">getConfig</span>.</p>
<p>As any read command it returns the configuration known to the
        follower to which your client is connected, which may be slightly
        out-of-date. One can use the <span class="codefrag command">sync</span> command for
        stronger guarantees. For example using the Java API:</p>
<pre class="code">zk.sync(ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE, void_callback, context);
zk.getConfig(watcher, callback, context);</pre>
<p>Note: in 3.5.0 it doesn't really matter which path is passed to the
        <span class="codefrag command">sync() </span> command as all the server's state is brought
        up to date with the leader (so one could use a different path instead of
        ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE). However, this may change in the future.</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_modifying"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Modifying the current dynamic configuration</h3>
<p>Modifying the configuration is done through the
        <span class="codefrag command">reconfig</span> command. There are two modes of
        reconfiguration: incremental and non-incremental (bulk). The
        non-incremental simply specifies the new dynamic configuration of the
        system. The incremental specifies changes to the current configuration.
        The <span class="codefrag command">reconfig</span> command returns the new
        configuration.</p>
<p>A few examples are in: <span class="codefrag filename">ReconfigTest.java</span>,
        <span class="codefrag filename">ReconfigRecoveryTest.java</span> and
        <span class="codefrag filename">TestReconfigServer.cc</span>.</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_general"></a>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>
<strong>Removing servers:</strong> Any server can
          be removed, including the leader (although removing the leader will
          result in a short unavailability, see Figures 6 and 8 in the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixfederatedconferencesweek/dynamic-recon%EF%AC%81guration-primarybackup-clusters">paper</a>). The server will not be shut-down automatically.
          Instead, it becomes a "non-voting follower". This is somewhat similar
          to an observer in that its votes don't count towards the Quorum of
          votes necessary to commit operations. However, unlike a non-voting
          follower, an observer doesn't actually see any operation proposals and
          does not ACK them. Thus a non-voting follower has a more significant
          negative effect on system throughput compared to an observer.
          Non-voting follower mode should only be used as a temporary mode,
          before shutting the server down, or adding it as a follower or as an
          observer to the ensemble. We do not shut the server down automatically
          for two main reasons. The first reason is that we do not want all the
          clients connected to this server to be immediately disconnected,
          causing a flood of connection requests to other servers. Instead, it
          is better if each client decides when to migrate independently. The
          second reason is that removing a server may sometimes (rarely) be
          necessary in order to change it from "observer" to "participant" (this
          is explained in the section <a href="#sc_reconfig_additional">Additional comments</a>).</p>
<p>Note that the new configuration should have some minimal number of
          participants in order to be considered legal. If the proposed change
          would leave the cluster with less than 2 participants and standalone
          mode is enabled (standaloneEnabled=true, see the section <a href="#sc_reconfig_standaloneEnabled">The standaloneEnabled flag</a>), the reconfig will not be
          processed (BadArgumentsException). If standalone mode is disabled
          (standaloneEnabled=false) then its legal to remain with 1 or more
          participants.</p>
<p>
<strong>Adding servers:</strong> Before a
          reconfiguration is invoked, the administrator must make sure that a
          quorum (majority) of participants from the new configuration are
          already connected and synced with the current leader. To achieve this
          we need to connect a new joining server to the leader before it is
          officially part of the ensemble. This is done by starting the joining
          server using an initial list of servers which is technically not a
          legal configuration of the system but (a) contains the joiner, and (b)
          gives sufficient information to the joiner in order for it to find and
          connect to the current leader. We list a few different options of
          doing this safely.</p>
<ol>
          
<li>
            
<p>Initial configuration of joiners is comprised of servers in
              the last committed configuration and one or more joiners, where
              <strong>joiners are listed as observers.</strong>
              For example, if servers D and E are added at the same time to (A,
              B, C) and server C is being removed, the initial configuration of
              D could be (A, B, C, D) or (A, B, C, D, E), where D and E are
              listed as observers. Similarly, the configuration of E could be
              (A, B, C, E) or (A, B, C, D, E), where D and E are listed as
              observers. <strong>Note that listing the joiners as
              observers will not actually make them observers - it will only
              prevent them from accidentally forming a quorum with other
              joiners.</strong> Instead, they will contact the servers in the
              current configuration and adopt the last committed configuration
              (A, B, C), where the joiners are absent. Configuration files of
              joiners are backed up and replaced automatically as this happens.
              After connecting to the current leader, joiners become non-voting
              followers until the system is reconfigured and they are added to
              the ensemble (as participant or observer, as appropriate).</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>Initial configuration of each joiner is comprised of servers
              in the last committed configuration + <strong>the
              joiner itself, listed as a participant.</strong> For example, to
              add a new server D to a configuration consisting of servers (A, B,
              C), the administrator can start D using an initial configuration
              file consisting of servers (A, B, C, D). If both D and E are added
              at the same time to (A, B, C), the initial configuration of D
              could be (A, B, C, D) and the configuration of E could be (A, B,
              C, E). Similarly, if D is added and C is removed at the same time,
              the initial configuration of D could be (A, B, C, D). Never list
              more than one joiner as participant in the initial configuration
              (see warning below).</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>Whether listing the joiner as an observer or as participant,
              it is also fine not to list all the current configuration servers,
              as long as the current leader is in the list. For example, when
              adding D we could start D with a configuration file consisting of
              just (A, D) if A is the current leader. however this is more
              fragile since if A fails before D officially joins the ensemble, D
              doesn&rsquo;t know anyone else and therefore the administrator will have
              to intervene and restart D with another server list.</p>
          
</li>
        
</ol>
<div class="note">
<div class="label">Warning</div>
<div class="content">
          
<title>Warning</title>
          
<p>Never specify more than one joining server in the same initial
            configuration as participants. Currently, the joining servers don&rsquo;t
            know that they are joining an existing ensemble; if multiple joiners
            are listed as participants they may form an independent quorum
            creating a split-brain situation such as processing operations
            independently from your main ensemble. It is OK to list multiple
            joiners as observers in an initial config.</p>
        
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, note that once connected to the leader, a joiner adopts
          the last committed configuration, in which it is absent (the initial
          config of the joiner is backed up before being rewritten). If the
          joiner restarts in this state, it will not be able to boot since it is
          absent from its configuration file. In order to start it you&rsquo;ll once
          again have to specify an initial configuration.</p>
<p>
<strong>Modifying server parameters:</strong> One
          can modify any of the ports of a server, or its role
          (participant/observer) by adding it to the ensemble with different
          parameters. This works in both the incremental and the bulk
          reconfiguration modes. It is not necessary to remove the server and
          then add it back; just specify the new parameters as if the server is
          not yet in the system. The server will detect the configuration change
          and perform the necessary adjustments. See an example in the section
          <a href="#sc_reconfig_incremental">Incremental mode</a> and an exception to this
          rule in the section <a href="#sc_reconfig_additional">Additional comments</a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to change the Quorum System used by the
          ensemble (for example, change the Majority Quorum System to a
          Hierarchical Quorum System on the fly). This, however, is only allowed
          using the bulk (non-incremental) reconfiguration mode. In general,
          incremental reconfiguration only works with the Majority Quorum
          System. Bulk reconfiguration works with both Hierarchical and Majority
          Quorum Systems.</p>
<p>
<strong>Performance Impact:</strong> There is
          practically no performance impact when removing a follower, since it
          is not being automatically shut down (the effect of removal is that
          the server's votes are no longer being counted). When adding a server,
          there is no leader change and no noticeable performance disruption.
          For details and graphs please see Figures 6, 7 and 8 in the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixfederatedconferencesweek/dynamic-recon%EF%AC%81guration-primarybackup-clusters">paper</a>.</p>
<p>The most significant disruption will happen when a leader change
          is caused, in one of the following cases:</p>
<ol>
          
<li>
            
<p>Leader is removed from the ensemble.</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>Leader's role is changed from participant to observer.</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>The port used by the leader to send transactions to others
              (quorum port) is modified.</p>
          
</li>
        
</ol>
<p>In these cases we perform a leader hand-off where the old leader
          nominates a new leader. The resulting unavailability is usually
          shorter than when a leader crashes since detecting leader failure is
          unnecessary and electing a new leader can usually be avoided during a
          hand-off (see Figures 6 and 8 in the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixfederatedconferencesweek/dynamic-recon%EF%AC%81guration-primarybackup-clusters">paper</a>).</p>
<p>When the client port of a server is modified, it does not drop
          existing client connections. New connections to the server will have
          to use the new client port.</p>
<p>
<strong>Progress guarantees:</strong> Up to the
          invocation of the reconfig operation, a quorum of the old
          configuration is required to be available and connected for ZooKeeper
          to be able to make progress. Once reconfig is invoked, a quorum of
          both the old and of the new configurations must be available. The
          final transition happens once (a) the new configuration is activated,
          and (b) all operations scheduled before the new configuration is
          activated by the leader are committed. Once (a) and (b) happen, only a
          quorum of the new configuration is required. Note, however, that
          neither (a) nor (b) are visible to a client. Specifically, when a
          reconfiguration operation commits, it only means that an activation
          message was sent out by the leader. It does not necessarily mean that
          a quorum of the new configuration got this message (which is required
          in order to activate it) or that (b) has happened. If one wants to
          make sure that both (a) and (b) has already occurred (for example, in
          order to know that it is safe to shut down old servers that were
          removed), one can simply invoke an update
          (<span class="codefrag command">set-data</span>, or some other quorum operation, but not
          a <span class="codefrag command">sync</span>) and wait for it to commit. An alternative
          way to achieve this was to introduce another round to the
          reconfiguration protocol (which, for simplicity and compatibility with
          Zab, we decided to avoid).</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_incremental"></a>
<h4>Incremental mode</h4>
<p>The incremental mode allows adding and removing servers to the
          current configuration. Multiple changes are allowed. For
          example:</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag userinput">&gt; reconfig -remove 3 -add
          server.5=125.23.63.23:1234:1235;1236</span>
</p>
<p>Both the add and the remove options get a list of comma separated
          arguments (no spaces):</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag userinput">&gt; reconfig -remove 3,4 -add
          server.5=localhost:2111:2112;2113,6=localhost:2114:2115:observer;2116</span>
</p>
<p>The format of the server statement is exactly the same as
          described in the section <a href="#sc_reconfig_clientport">Specifying the client port</a> and
          includes the client port. Notice that here instead of "server.5=" you
          can just say "5=". In the example above, if server 5 is already in the
          system, but has different ports or is not an observer, it is updated
          and once the configuration commits becomes an observer and starts
          using these new ports. This is an easy way to turn participants into
          observers and vise versa or change any of their ports, without
          rebooting the server.</p>
<p>ZooKeeper supports two types of Quorum Systems &ndash; the simple
          Majority system (where the leader commits operations after receiving
          ACKs from a majority of voters) and a more complex Hierarchical
          system, where votes of different servers have different weights and
          servers are divided into voting groups. Currently, incremental
          reconfiguration is allowed only if the last proposed configuration
          known to the leader uses a Majority Quorum System
          (BadArgumentsException is thrown otherwise).</p>
<p>Incremental mode - examples using the Java API:</p>
<pre class="code">List&lt;String&gt; leavingServers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

<h4>Non-incremental mode</h4>
<p>The second mode of reconfiguration is non-incremental, whereby a
          client gives a complete specification of the new dynamic system
          configuration. The new configuration can either be given in place or
          read from a file:</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag userinput">&gt; reconfig -file newconfig.cfg
          </span>//newconfig.cfg is a dynamic config file, see <a href="#sc_reconfig_file">Dynamic configuration file</a>
</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag userinput">&gt; reconfig -members
          server.1=125.23.63.23:2780:2783:participant;2791,server.2=125.23.63.24:2781:2784:participant;2792,server.3=125.23.63.25:2782:2785:participant;2793</span>
</p>
<p>The new configuration may use a different Quorum System. For
          example, you may specify a Hierarchical Quorum System even if the
          current ensemble uses a Majority Quorum System.</p>
<p>Bulk mode - example using the Java API:</p>
<pre class="code">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; newMembers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
newMembers.add("server.1=1111:1234:1235;1236");
newMembers.add("server.2=1112:1237:1238;1239");
newMembers.add("server.3=1114:1240:1241:observer;1242");

byte[] config = zk.reconfig(null, null, newMembers, -1, new Stat());

String configStr = new String(config);
System.out.println(configStr);</pre>
<p>There is also an asynchronous API, and an API accepting comma
          separated String containing the new members instead of
          List&lt;String&gt;. See
          src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooKeeper.java.</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_conditional"></a>
<h4>Conditional reconfig</h4>
<p>Sometimes (especially in non-incremental mode) a new proposed
          configuration depends on what the client "believes" to be the current
          configuration, and should be applied only to that configuration.
          Specifically, the <span class="codefrag command">reconfig</span> succeeds only if the
          last configuration at the leader has the specified version.</p>
<p>
<span class="codefrag userinput">&gt; reconfig -file &lt;filename&gt; -v &lt;version&gt;</span>
</p>
<p>In the previously listed Java examples, instead of -1 one could
          specify a configuration version to condition the
          reconfiguration.</p>
<a name="sc_reconfig_errors"></a>
<h4>Error conditions</h4>
<p>In addition to normal ZooKeeper error conditions, a
          reconfiguration may fail for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
          
<li>
            
<p>another reconfig is currently in progress
              (ReconfigInProgress)</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>the proposed change would leave the cluster with less than 2
              participants, in case standalone mode is enabled, or, if
              standalone mode is disabled then its legal to remain with 1 or
              more participants (BadArgumentsException)</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>no quorum of the new configuration was connected and
              up-to-date with the leader when the reconfiguration processing
              began (NewConfigNoQuorum)</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>
<span class="codefrag userinput">-v x</span> was specified, but the version
              <span class="codefrag userinput">y</span> of the latest configuration is not
              <span class="codefrag userinput">x</span> (BadVersionException)</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>an incremental reconfiguration was requested but the last
              configuration at the leader uses a Quorum System which is
              different from the Majority system (BadArgumentsException)</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>syntax error (BadArgumentsException)</p>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            
<p>I/O exception when reading the configuration from a file
              (BadArgumentsException)</p>
          
</li>
        
</ol>
<p>Most of these are illustrated by test-cases in
          <span class="codefrag filename">ReconfigFailureCases.java</span>.</p>

<h4>Additional comments</h4>
<p>
<strong>Liveness:</strong> To better understand
          the difference between incremental and non-incremental
          reconfiguration, suppose that client C1 adds server D to the system
          while a different client C2 adds server E. With the non-incremental
          mode, each client would first invoke <span class="codefrag command">config</span> to find
          out the current configuration, and then locally create a new list of
          servers by adding its own suggested server. The new configuration can
          then be submitted using the non-incremental
          <span class="codefrag command">reconfig</span> command. After both reconfigurations
          complete, only one of E or D will be added (not both), depending on
          which client's request arrives second to the leader, overwriting the
          previous configuration. The other client can repeat the process until
          its change takes effect. This method guarantees system-wide progress
          (i.e., for one of the clients), but does not ensure that every client
          succeeds. To have more control C2 may request to only execute the
          reconfiguration in case the version of the current configuration
          hasn't changed, as explained in the section <a href="#sc_reconfig_conditional">Conditional reconfig</a>. In this way it may avoid blindly
          overwriting the configuration of C1 if C1's configuration reached the
          leader first.</p>
<p>With incremental reconfiguration, both changes will take effect as
          they are simply applied by the leader one after the other to the
          current configuration, whatever that is (assuming that the second
          reconfig request reaches the leader after it sends a commit message
          for the first reconfig request -- currently the leader will refuse to
          propose a reconfiguration if another one is already pending). Since
          both clients are guaranteed to make progress, this method guarantees
          stronger liveness. In practice, multiple concurrent reconfigurations
          are probably rare. Non-incremental reconfiguration is currently the
          only way to dynamically change the Quorum System. Incremental
          configuration is currently only allowed with the Majority Quorum
          System.</p>
<p>
<strong>Changing an observer into a
          follower:</strong> Clearly, changing a server that participates in
          voting into an observer may fail if error (2) occurs, i.e., if fewer
          than the minimal allowed number of participants would remain. However,
          converting an observer into a participant may sometimes fail for a
          more subtle reason: Suppose, for example, that the current
          configuration is (A, B, C, D), where A is the leader, B and C are
          followers and D is an observer. In addition, suppose that B has
          crashed. If a reconfiguration is submitted where D is said to become a
          follower, it will fail with error (3) since in this configuration, a
          majority of voters in the new configuration (any 3 voters), must be
          connected and up-to-date with the leader. An observer cannot
          acknowledge the history prefix sent during reconfiguration, and
          therefore it does not count towards these 3 required servers and the
          reconfiguration will be aborted. In case this happens, a client can
          achieve the same task by two reconfig commands: first invoke a
          reconfig to remove D from the configuration and then invoke a second
          command to add it back as a participant (follower). During the
          intermediate state D is a non-voting follower and can ACK the state
          transfer performed during the second reconfig comand.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Rebalancing Client Connections</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>When a ZooKeeper cluster is started, if each client is given the same
      connection string (list of servers), the client will randomly choose a
      server in the list to connect to, which makes the expected number of
      client connections per server the same for each of the servers. We
      implemented a method that preserves this property when the set of servers
      changes through reconfiguration. See Sections 4 and 5.1 in the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixfederatedconferencesweek/dynamic-recon%EF%AC%81guration-primarybackup-clusters">paper</a>.</p>
<p>In order for the method to work, all clients must subscribe to
      configuration changes (by setting a watch on /zookeeper/config either
      directly or through the <span class="codefrag command">getConfig</span> API command). When
      the watch is triggered, the client should read the new configuration by
      invoking <span class="codefrag command">sync</span> and <span class="codefrag command">getConfig</span> and if
      the configuration is indeed new invoke the
      <span class="codefrag command">updateServerList</span> API command. To avoid mass client
      migration at the same time, it is better to have each client sleep a
      random short period of time before invoking
      <span class="codefrag command">updateServerList</span>.</p>
<p>A few examples can be found in:
      <span class="codefrag filename">StaticHostProviderTest.java</span> and
      <span class="codefrag filename">TestReconfig.cc</span>
</p>
<p>Example (this is not a recipe, but a simplified example just to
      explain the general idea):</p>
<pre class="code">
public void process(WatchedEvent event) {
    synchronized (this) {
        if (event.getType() == EventType.None) {
            connected = (event.getState() == KeeperState.SyncConnected);
            notifyAll();
        } else if (event.getPath()!=null &amp;&amp;  event.getPath().equals(ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE)) {
            // in prod code never block the event thread!
            zk.sync(ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE, this, null);
            zk.getConfig(this, this, null);
        }
    }
}
public void processResult(int rc, String path, Object ctx, byte[] data, Stat stat) {
    if (path!=null &amp;&amp;  path.equals(ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE)) {
        String config[] = ConfigUtils.getClientConfigStr(new String(data)).split(" ");   // similar to config -c
        long version = Long.parseLong(config[0], 16);
        if (this.configVersion == null){
             this.configVersion = version;

            try {
                // the following command is not blocking but may cause the client to close the socket and
                // migrate to a different server. In practice its better to wait a short period of time, chosen
                // randomly, so that different clients migrate at different times
                zk.updateServerList(hostList);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Error updating server list");
                e.printStackTrace();
