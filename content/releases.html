<h2>Release strategy</h2>
<p>The Apache ZooKeeper community supports two release branches at a time: <strong>stable</strong> and <strong>current</strong>. The <strong>stable</strong> version of ZooKeeper is 3.8.x and the <strong>current</strong> version is 3.9.x. Once a new minor version is released, the <strong>stable</strong> version is expected to be decommissioned soon and in approximately half a year will be announced as End-of-Life. During the half year grace period only security and critical fixes are expected to be released for the version. After EoL is announced no further patches are provided by the community. All ZooKeeper releases will remain accessible from <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/">the official Apache Archives</a>.</p>

<h3>2 April, 2019: release 3.4.14 available</h3>
<p>This is a bugfix release. It fixes 8 issues, mostly build / unit tests issues, dependency updates flagged by OWASP, NPE and a name resolution problem.

<h3>15 July, 2018: release 3.4.13 available</h3>
<p>This is a bugfix release. It fixes 17 issues, including issues such as ZOOKEEPER-2959 that could cause data loss when observer is used, and ZOOKEEPER-2184 that prevents ZooKeeper Java clients working in dynamic IP (container / cloud) environment. See <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.13/releasenotes.html">ZooKeeper 3.4.13 Release Notes</a> for details.</p>
<h3>17 May, 2018: release 3.5.4-beta available</h3>
<p>3.5.4-beta is the second beta in the planned 3.5 release line leading up to a stable 3.5 release. It comprises 113 bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Release 3.5.3 added a new feature ZOOKEEPER-2169 &quot;Enable creation of nodes with TTLs&quot;. There was a major oversight when TTL nodes were implemented. The session ID generator for each server is seeded with the configured Server ID in the high byte. TTL Nodes were using the highest bit to denote a TTL node when used in the ephemeral owner. This meant that Server IDs &gt; 127 that created ephemeral nodes would have those nodes always considered TTL nodes (with the TTL being essentially a random number). ZOOKEEPER-2901 fixes the issue. By default TTL is disabled and must now be enabled in zoo.cfg. When TTL Nodes are enabled, the max Server ID changes from 255 to 254. See the documentation for TTL in the administrator guide (or the referenced JIRAs) for more details.</p>
