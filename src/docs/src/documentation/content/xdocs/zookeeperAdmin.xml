    <para>The first two sections assume you are interested in installing
    ZooKeeper in a production environment such as a datacenter. The final
    section covers situations in which you are setting up ZooKeeper on a
    limited basis - for evaluation, testing, or development - but not in a
    production environment.</para>

    <section id="sc_systemReq">
      <title>System Requirements</title>

      <para>ZooKeeper runs in Java, release 1.5 or greater (JDK 5 or greater).
      It runs as an <emphasis>ensemble</emphasis> of ZooKeeper servers. Three ZooKeeper
      servers is the minimum recommended size for an ensemble, and we also recommend that
      they run on separate machines. At Yahoo!, ZooKeeper is usually deployed on 
      dedicated RHEL boxes, with dual-core processors, 2GB of RAM, and 80GB IDE hard 
      drives.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="sc_zkMulitServerSetup">
      <title>Clustered (Multi-Server) Setup</title>

      <para>For reliable ZooKeeper service, you should deploy ZooKeeper in a
      cluster known as an <emphasis>ensemble</emphasis>. As long as a majority
      of the ensemble are up, the service will be available. Because Zookeeper
      requires a majority, it is best to use an
      odd number of machines. For example, with four machines ZooKeeper can
      only handle the failure of a single machine; if two machines fail, the
      remaining two machines do not constitute a majority. However, with five
      machines ZooKeeper can handle the failure of two machines. </para>

      <para>Here are the steps to setting a server that will be part of an
      ensemble. These steps should be performed on every host in the
      ensemble:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Set the Java heap size. This is very important to avoid
          swapping, which will seriously degrade ZooKeeper performance. To
          determine the correct value, use load tests, and make sure you are
          well below the usage limit that would cause you to swap. Be
          conservative - use a maximum heap size of 3GB for a 4GB
          machine.</para>

          <para>Create a configuration file. This file can be called anything.
          Use the following settings as a starting point:</para>

          <para><computeroutput>
tickTime=2000
dataDir=/var/zookeeper/
clientPort=2181
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
server.1=zoo1:2888:3888
server.2=zoo2:2888:3888
server.3=zoo3:2888:3888</computeroutput></para>

          <para>You can find the meanings of these and other configuration
          settings in the section <xref linkend="sc_configuration" />. A word
          though about a few here:</para>

          <para>Every machine that is part of the ZooKeeper ensemble should know
          about every other machine in the ensemble. You accomplish this with
          the series of lines of the form <emphasis
          role="bold">server.id=host:port:port</emphasis>. The parameters <emphasis
          role="bold">host</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="bold">port</emphasis> are straightforward. You attribute the
          server id to each machine by creating a file named
          <filename>myid</filename>, one for each server, which resides in
          that server's data directory, as specified by the configuration file
          parameter <emphasis role="bold">dataDir</emphasis>. The myid file
          consists of a single line containing only the text of that machine's
          id. So <filename>myid</filename> of server 1 would contain the text
          "1" and nothing else. The id must be unique within the
          ensemble.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If your configuration file is set up, you can start
          ZooKeeper:</para>

              <para>In C, you can compile either the single threaded client or
              the multithreaded client: or n the c subdirectory in the

          <para>Running either program gives you a shell in which to execute

    <section id="sc_dataFileManagement">
      <title>Data File Management</title>

      <para>ZooKeeper stores its data in a data directory and its transaction
      log in a transaction log directory. By default these two directories are
      the same. The server can (and should) be configured to store the
      transaction log files in a separate directory than the data files.
      Throughput increases and latency decreases when transaction logs reside
      on a dedicated log devices.</para>

      <section>
        <title>The Data Directory</title>

        <para>This directory has two files in it:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><filename>myid</filename> - contains a single integer in
            human readable ASCII text that represents the server id.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><filename>snapshot.&lt;zxid&gt;</filename> - holds the fuzzy
            snapshot of a data tree.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Each ZooKeeper server has a unique id. This id is used in two
        places: the <filename>myid</filename> file and the configuration file.
        The <filename>myid</filename> file identifies the server that
        corresponds to the given data directory. The configuration file lists
        the contact information for each server identified by its server id.
        When a ZooKeeper server instance starts, it reads its id from the
        <filename>myid</filename> file and then, using that id, reads from the
        configuration file, looking up the port on which it should
        listen.</para>

        <para>The <filename>snapshot</filename> files stored in the data
        directory are fuzzy snapshots in the sense that during the time the
        ZooKeeper server is taking the snapshot, updates are occurring to the
        data tree. The suffix of the <filename>snapshot</filename> file names
        is the <emphasis>zxid</emphasis>, the ZooKeeper transaction id, of the
        last committed transaction at the start of the snapshot. Thus, the
        snapshot includes a subset of the updates to the data tree that
        occurred while the snapshot was in process. The snapshot, then, may
        not correspond to any data tree that actually existed, and for this
        reason we refer to it as a fuzzy snapshot. Still, ZooKeeper can
        recover using this snapshot because it takes advantage of the
        idempotent nature of its updates. By replaying the transaction log
        against fuzzy snapshots ZooKeeper gets the state of the system at the
        end of the log.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The Log Directory</title>

        <para>The Log Directory contains the ZooKeeper transaction logs.
        Before any update takes place, ZooKeeper ensures that the transaction
        that represents the update is written to non-volatile storage. A new
        log file is started each time a snapshot is begun. The log file's
        suffix is the first zxid written to that log.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>File Management</title>

        <para>The format of snapshot and log files does not change between
        standalone ZooKeeper servers and different configurations of
        replicated ZooKeeper servers. Therefore, you can pull these files from
        a running replicated ZooKeeper server to a development machine with a
        stand-alone ZooKeeper server for trouble shooting.</para>

        <para>Using older log and snapshot files, you can look at the previous
        state of ZooKeeper servers and even restore that state. The
        LogFormatter class allows an administrator to look at the transactions
        in a log.</para>

        <para>The ZooKeeper server creates snapshot and log files, but never
        deletes them. The retention policy of the data and log files is
        implemented outside of the ZooKeeper server. The server itself only
        needs the latest complete fuzzy snapshot and the log files from the
        start of that snapshot. The PurgeTxnLog utility implements a simple
        retention policy that administrators can use.</para>

      <title>Things to Avoid</title>

            <para>The list of ZooKeeper servers used by the clients must match
            the list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper server has.
            Things work okay if the client list is a subset of the real list,
            but things will really act strange if clients have a list of
            ZooKeeper servers that are in different ZooKeeper clusters. Also,
            the server lists in each Zookeeper server configuration file
            should be consistent with one another.</para>

          <term>incorrect placement of transasction log</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>The most performance critical part of ZooKeeper is the
            transaction log. ZooKeeper syncs transactions to media before it
            returns a response. A dedicated transaction log device is key to
            consistent good performance. Putting the log on a busy device will
            adversely effect performance. If you only have one storage device,
            put trace files on NFS and increase the snapshotCount; it doesn't
            eliminate the problem, but it should mitigate it.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>incorrect Java heap size</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>You should take special care to set your Java max heap size
            correctly. In particular, you should not create a situation in
            which ZooKeeper swaps to disk. The disk is death to ZooKeeper.
            Everything is ordered, so if processing one request swaps the
            disk, all other queued requests will probably do the same. the
            disk. DON'T SWAP.</para>

            <para>Be conservative in your estimates: if you have 4G of RAM, do
            not set the Java max heap size to 6G or even 4G. For example, it
            is more likely you would use a 3G heap for a 4G machine, as the
            operating system and the cache also need memory. The best and only
            recommend practice for estimating the heap size your system needs
            is to run load tests, and then make sure you are well below the
            usage limit that would cause the system to swap.</para>
