    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document is a guide for developers wishing to create
    distributed applications that take advantage of ZooKeeper's coordination
    services. It contains conceptual and practical information.</para>

    <para>The first four sections of this guide present higher level
    discussions of various ZooKeeper concepts. These are necessary both for an
    understanding of how Zookeeper works as well how to work with it. It does
    not contain source code, but it does assume a familiarity with the
    problems associated with distributed computing. The sections in this first
    group are:</para>

    <para>The book concludes with an <ulink

    useful, ZooKeeper-related information.</para>

    <para>Most of information in this document is written to be accessible as
    stand-alone reference material. However, before starting your first
    ZooKeeper application, you should probably at least read the chaptes on
    the <ulink url="#ch_zkDataModel">ZooKeeper Data Model</ulink> and <ulink
    url="#ch_guideToZkOperations">ZooKeeper Basic Operations</ulink>. Also,
    the <ulink url="#ch_programStructureWithExample">Simple Programmming
    Example</ulink> <emphasis>[tbd]</emphasis> is helpful for understand the basic
    structure of a ZooKeeper client application.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="ch_zkDataModel">
    <title>The ZooKeeper Data Model</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper has a hierarchal name space, much like a distributed file
    system. The only difference is that each node in the namespace can have
    data associated with it as well as children. It is like having a file
    system that allows a file to also be a directory. Paths to nodes are
    always expressed as canonical, absolute, slash-separated paths; there are
    no relative reference. Any unicode character can be used in a path subject
    to the following constraints:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The null character (\u0000) cannot be part of a path name. (This
        causes problems with the C binding.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The following characters can't be used because they don't
        display well, or render in confusing ways: \u0001 - \u0019 and \u007F
        - \u009F.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The following characters are not allowed: \ud800 -uF8FFF,
        \uFFF0-uFFFF, \uXFFFE - \uXFFFF (where X is a digit 1 - E), \uF0000 -
        \uFFFFF.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The "." character can be used as part of another name, but "."
        and ".." cannot alone be used to indicate a node along a path,
        because ZooKeeper doesn't use relative paths. The following would be
        invalid: "/a/b/./c" or "/a/b/../c".</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The token "zookeeper" is reserved.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="sc_zkDataModel_znodes">
      <title>ZNodes</title>

      <para>Every node in a ZooKeeper tree is refered to as a
      <emphasis>znode</emphasis>. Znodes maintain a stat structure that
      includes version numbers for data changes, acl changes. The stat
      structure also has timestamps. The version number, together with the
      timestamp allow ZooKeeper to validate the cache and to coordinate
      updates. Each time a znode's data changes, the version number increases.
      For instance, whenever a client retrieves data, it also receives the
      version of the data. And when a client performs an update or a delete,
      it must supply the version of the data of the znode it is changing. If
      the version it supplies doesn't match the actual version of the data,
      the update will fail. (This behavior can be overridden. For more
      information see... )<emphasis>[tbd...]</emphasis></para>

      <note>
        <para>In distributed application engineering, the word
        <emphasis>node</emphasis> can refer to a generic host machine, a
        server, a member of an ensemble, a client process, etc. In the ZooKeeper
        documentatin, <emphasis>znodes</emphasis> refer to the data nodes.
        <emphasis>Servers</emphasis> to refer to machines that make up the
        ZooKeeper service; <emphasis>quorum peers</emphasis> refer to the
        servers that make up an ensemble; client refers to any host or process
        which uses a ZooKeeper service.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Znodes are the main enitity that a programmer access. They have
      several characteristics that are worth mentioning here.</para>

      <section id="sc_zkDataMode_watches">
        <title>Watches</title>

        <para>Clients can set watches on znodes. Changes to that znode trigger
        the watch and then clear the watch. When a watch triggers, ZooKeeper
        sends the client a notification. More information about watches can be
        found in the section 
	    <ulink url="#ch_zkWatches">Zookeeper Watches</ulink>.
        <emphasis>[tbd]</emphasis></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Data Access</title>

        <para>The data stored at each znode in a namespace is read and written
        atomically. Reads get all the data bytes associated with a znode and a
        write replaces all the data. Each node has an Access Control List
        (ACL) that restricts who can do what.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Ephemeral Nodes</title>

        <para>ZooKeeper also has the notion of ephemeral nodes. These znodes
        exists as long as the session that created the znode is active. When
        the session ends the znode is deleted. Because of this behavior
        ephemeral znodes are not allowed to have children.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Unique Naming</title>

        <para>Finally you create a znode, you can request that ZooKeeper
        append a monotonicly increasing counter be appended to the path name
        of the znode to be requested. This counter is unique to the parent
        znode.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="sc_timeInZk">
      <title>Time in ZooKeeper</title>

      <para>ZooKeeper tracks time multiple ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Zxid</emphasis></para>

          <para>Every change to the ZooKeeper state receives a stamp in the
          form of a <emphasis>zxid</emphasis> (ZooKeeper Transaction Id).
          This exposes the total ordering of all changes to ZooKeeper. Each
          change will have a unique zxid and if zxid1 is smaller than zxid2
          then zxid1 happened before zxid2.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Version numbers</emphasis></para>

          <para>Every change to a a node will cause an increase to one of the
          version numbers of that node. The three version numbers are version
          (number of changes to the data of a znode), cversion (number of
          changes to the children of a znode), and aversion (number of changes
          to the ACL of a znode).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Ticks</emphasis></para>

          <para>When using multi-server ZooKeeper, servers use ticks to define
          timing of events such as status uploads, session timeouts,
          connection timeouts between peers, etc. The tick time is only
          indirectly exposed through the minimum session timeout (2 times the
          tick time); if a client requests a session timeout less than the
          minimum session timeout, the server will tell the client that the
          session timeout is actually the minimum session timeout.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Real time</emphasis></para>

          <para>ZooKeeper doesn't use real time, or clock time, at all except
          to put timestamps into the stat structure on znode creation and

  </section>

  <section id="ch_zkSessions">
    <title>ZooKeeper Sessions</title>

    <para>When a client gets a handle to the ZooKeeper service, ZooKeeper
    creates a ZooKeeper session, represented as a 64-bit number, that it
    assigns to the client. If the client connects to a different ZooKeeper
    server, it will send the session id as a part of the connection handshake.
    As a security measure, the server creates a password for the session id
    that any ZooKeeper server can validate.The password is sent to the client with the session id when the
    client establishes the session. The client sends this password with the
    session id whenever it reestablishes the session with a new server.</para>

    <para>One of the parameters to the ZooKeeper client library call to create
    a ZooKeeper session is the session timeout in milliseconds. The client
    sends a requested timeout, the server responds with the timeout that it
    can give the client. The current implementation requires that the timeout
    be between 2 times the tickTime (as set in the server configuration) and
    60 seconds.</para>

    <para>The session is kept alive by requests sent by the client. If the
    session is idle for a period of time that would timeout the session, the
    client will send a PING request to keep the session alive. This PING
    request not only allows the ZooKeeper server to know that the client is
    still active, but it also allows the client to verify that its connection
    to the ZooKeeper server is still active. The timing of the PING is
    conservative enough to ensure reasonable time to detect a dead connection
    and reconnect to a new server.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="ch_zkWatches">
    <title>ZooKeeper Watches</title>

    <para>All of the read operations in ZooKeeper - <emphasis
    role="bold">getData()</emphasis>, <emphasis
    role="bold">getChildren()</emphasis>, and <emphasis
    role="bold">exists()</emphasis> - have the option of setting a watch as a
    side effect. Here is ZooKeeper's definition of a watch: a watch event is
    one-time trigger, sent to the client that set the watch, which occurs when
    the data for which the watch was set changes. There are three key points
    to consider in this definition of a watch:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">One-time trigger</emphasis></para>

        <para>One watch event will be sent to the client the data has changed.
        For example, if a client does a getData("/znode1", true) and later the
        data for /znode1 is changed or deleted, the client will get a watch
        event for /znode1. If /znode1 changes again, no watch event will be
        sent unless the client has done another read that sets a new
        watch.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sent to the client</emphasis></para>

        <para>This implies that an event is on the way to the client, but may
        not reach the client before the successful return code to the change
        operation reaches the client that initiated the change. Watches are
        sent asynchronously to watchers. ZooKeeper provides an ordering
        guarantee: a client will never see a change for which it has set a
        watch until it first sees the watch event. Network delays or other
        factors may cause different clients to see watches and return codes
        from updates at different times. The key point is that everything seen
        by the different clients will have a consistent order.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The data for which the watch was
        set</emphasis></para>

        <para>This refers to the different ways a node can change. ZooKeeper
        maintains two lists of watches: data watches and child watches.
        getData() and exists() set data watches. getChildren() sets child
        watches. Thus, setData() will trigger data watches for the znode being
        set (assuming the set is successful). A successful create() will
        trigger a data watch for the znode being created and a child watch for
        the parent znode. A successful delete() will trigger both a data watch
        and a child watch (since there can be no more children) for a znode
        being deleted as well as a child watch for the parent znode.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Watches are maintained locally at the ZooKeeper server to which the
    client is connected. This allows watches to be light weight to set,
    maintain, and dispatch. It also means if a client connects to a different
    server, the new server is not going to know about its watches. So, when a
    client gets a disconnect event, it must consider that an implicit trigger
    of all watches. When a client reconnects to a new server, the client
    should re-set any watches that it is still interested in.</para>

    <section id="sc_WatchGuarantees">
      <title>What ZooKeeper Guarantees about Watches</title>

      <para>With regard to watches, ZooKeeper maintains these
      guarantees:</para>

  <section id="sc_ZooKeeperAccessControl">
    <title>ZooKeeper access control using ACLs</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper uses ACLs to control access to its znodes (the data nodes of a ZooKeeper data tree). The ACL implementation is quite similar to UNIX file access permissions: it employs permission bits to allow/disallow various operations against a node and the scope to which the bits apply. Unlike standard UNIX permissions, a ZooKeeper node is not limited by the three standard scopes for user (owner of the file), group, and world (other). ZooKeeper does not have a notion of an owner of a znode. Instead, an ACL specifies sets of ids and permissions that are associated with those ids.</para>

    <para>ZooKeeper supports pluggable authentication schemes. Ids are specified using the form <emphasis>scheme:id</emphasis>, where <emphasis>scheme</emphasis> is a the authentication scheme that the id corresponds to. For example, <emphasis>host:host1.corp.com</emphasis> is an id for a host named <emphasis>host1.corp.com</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>When a client connects to ZooKeeper and authenticates itself, ZooKeeper associates all the ids that correspond to a client with the clients connection. These ids are checked against the ACLs of znodes when a clients tries to access a node. ACLs are made up of pairs of <emphasis>(scheme:expression, perms)</emphasis>. The format of the <emphasis>expression</emphasis> is specific to the scheme. For example, the pair <emphasis>(ip:19.22.0.0/16, READ)</emphasis> gives the <emphasis>READ</emphasis> permission to any clients with an IP address that starts with 19.22.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis> and <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> permissions have been broken out of the <emphasis>WRITE</emphasis> permission for finer grained access controls. The cases for <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis> and <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> are the following:</para>

      <para>You want A to be able to do a set on a zookeeper node, but not be able to <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis> or <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> children.</para>

      <para><emphasis>CREATE</emphasis> without <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis>: clients create requests by creating zookeeper nodes in a parent directory. You want all clients to be able to add, but only request processor can delete. (This is kind of like the APPEND permission for files.)</para>

      <para>Also, the <emphasis>ADMIN</emphasis> permission is there since Zookeeper doesn’t have a notion of file owner. In some sense the <emphasis>ADMIN</emphasis> permission designates the entity as the owner. Zookeeper doesn’t support the LOOKUP permission (execute permission bit on directories to allow you to LOOKUP even though you can't list the directory). Everyone implicitly has LOOKUP permission. This allows you to stat a node, but nothing more. (The problem is, if you want to call zoo_exists() on a node that doesn't exist, there is no permission to check.)</para>

      <para>The OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE is completely open free for all ACL: any application can execute any operation on the node and can create, list and delete its children. The READ_ACL_UNSAFE is read-only access for any application. CREATE_ALL_ACL grants all permissions to the creator of the node. The creator must have been authenticated by the server (for example, using “<emphasis>digest</emphasis>” scheme) before it can create nodes with this ACL.</para>

    <title>Consistency Guarantees</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper is a high performance, scalable service. Both reads and
    write operations are designed to be fast, though reads are faster than
    writes. The reason for this is that in the case of reads, ZooKeeper can
    serve older data, which in turn is due to ZooKeeper's consistency

            <term>Simultaneously Conistent Cross-Client Views</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>ZooKeeper does not guarantee that at every instance in

              ZooKeeper data. Due to factors like network delays, one client
              may perform an update before another client gets notified of the
              change. Consider the scenario of two clients, A and B. If client
              A sets the value of a znode /a from 0 to 1, then tells client B
              to read /a, client B may read the old value of 0, depending on
              which server it is connected to. If it
              is important that Client A and Client B read the same value,
              Client B should should call the <emphasis

              method before it performs its read.</para>

              <para>So, ZooKeeper by itself doesn't guarantee that changes occur 
              synchronously across all servers, but ZooKeeper

              provide useful client synchronization. (For more information,

  <section id="ch_bindings">
    <title>Bindings</title>

    <para>The ZooKeeper client libraries come in two languages: Java and C.
    The following sections describe these.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Java Binding</title>

      <para>There are two packages that make up the ZooKeeper Java binding:
      <emphasis role="bold">org.apache.zookeeper</emphasis> and <emphasis
      role="bold">org.apache.zookeeper.data</emphasis>. The rest of the
      packages that make up ZooKeeper are used internally or are part of the
      server implementation. The <emphasis
      role="bold">org.apache.zookeeper.data</emphasis> package is made up of
      generated classes that are used simply as containers.</para>

      <para>The main class used by a ZooKeeper Java client is the <emphasis
      role="bold">ZooKeeper</emphasis> class. Its two constructors differ only
      by an optional session id and password. ZooKeeper supports session
      recovery accross instances of a process. A Java program may save its
      session id and password to stable storage, restart, and recover the
      session that was used by the earlier instance of the program.</para>

      <para>When a ZooKeeper object is created, two threads are created as
      well: an IO thread and an event thread. All IO happens on the IO thread
      (using Java NIO). All event callbacks happen on the event thread.
      Session maintenance such as reconnecting to ZooKeeper servers and
      maintaining heartbeat is done on the IO thread. Responses for
      synchronous methods are also processed in the IO thread. All responses
      to asynchronous methods and watch events are processed on the event
      thread. There are a few things to notice that result from this
      design:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All completions for asynchronous calls and watcher callbacks
          will be made in order, one at a time. The caller can do any
          processing they wish, but no other callbacks will be processed
          during that time.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Callbacks do not block the processing of the IO thread or the
          processing of the synchronous calls.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Synchronous calls may not return in the correct order. For
          example, assume a client does the following processing: issues an
          asynchronous read of node <emphasis role="bold">/a</emphasis> with
          <emphasis>watch</emphasis> set to true, and then in the completion
          callback of the read it does a synchronous read of <emphasis
          role="bold">/a</emphasis>. (Maybe not good practice, but not illegal
          either, and it makes for a simple example.)</para>

          <para>Note that if there is a change to <emphasis
          role="bold">/a</emphasis> between the asynchronous read and the
          synchronous read, the client library will receive the watch event
          saying <emphasis role="bold">/a</emphasis> changed before the
          response for the synchronous read, but because the completion
          callback is blocking the event queue, the synchronous read will
          return with the new value of <emphasis role="bold">/a</emphasis>
          before the watch event is processed.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Finally, the rules associated with shutdown are straightforward:
      once a ZooKeeper object is closed or receives a fatal event
      (SESSION_EXPIRED and AUTH_FAILED), the ZooKeeper object becomes invalid,
      the two threads shut down, and any further ZooKeeper calls throw
      errors.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>C Binding</title>

      <para>The C binding has a single-threaded and multi-threaded library.
      The multi-threaded library is easiest to use and is most similar to the
      Java API. This library will create an IO thread and an event dispatch
      thread for handling connection maintenance and callbacks. The
      single-threaded library allows ZooKeeper to be used in event driven
      applications by exposing the event loop used in the multi-threaded
      library.</para>

      <para>The package includes two shared libraries: zookeeper_st and
      zookeeper_mt. The former only provides the asynchronous APIs and
      callbacks for integrating into the application's event loop. The only
      reason this library exists is to support the platforms were a
      <emphasis>pthread</emphasis> library is not available or is unstable
      (i.e. FreeBSD 4.x). In all other cases, application developers should
      link with zookeeper_mt, as it includes support for both Sync and Async
      API.</para>

        <title>Using the Client</title>

        <para>You can test your client by running a zookeeper server (see
        instructions on the project wiki page on how to run it) and connecting
        to it using one of the cli applications that were built as part of the
        installation procedure. cli_mt (multithreaded, built against
        zookeeper_mt library) is shown in this example, but you could also use
        cli_st (singlethreaded, built against zookeeper_st library):</para>

        <para><command>$ cli_mt zookeeper_host:9876</command></para>

        <para>This
        is a client application that gives you a shell for executing simple
        zookeeper commands. Once succesully started and connected to the
        server it displays a shell prompt. You can now enter zookeeper
        commands. For example, to create a node:</para>

        <programlisting>&gt; create /my_new_node</programlisting>

        <para>To verify that the node's been created:</para>

        <para>You should see a list of node who are children of the root node
        "/".</para>

    <title>Gotchas: Common Problems and Troubleshooting</title>

    <para>So now you know ZooKeeper. It's fast, simple, your application
    works, but wait ... something's wrong. Here are some pitfalls that
    ZooKeeper users fall into:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you are using watches, you must look for the connected watch
        event. When a ZooKeeper client disconnects from a server, all the
        watches are removed, so a client must treat the disconnect event as an
        implicit trigger of watches. The easiest way to deal with this is to
        act like the connected watch event is a watch trigger for all your
        watches. The connected event makes a better trigger than the
        disconnected event because you can access ZooKeeper and reestablish
        watches when you are connected.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You must test ZooKeeper server failures. The ZooKeeper service
        can survive failures as long as a majority of servers are active. The
        question to ask is: can your application handle it? In the real world
        a client's connection to ZooKeeper can break. (ZooKeeper server
        failures and network partitions are common reasons for connection
        loss.) The ZooKeeper client library takes care of recovering your
        connection and letting you know what happened, but you must make sure
        that you recover your state and any outstanding requests that failed.
        Find out if you got it right in the test lab, not in production - test
        with a ZooKeeper service made up of a several of servers and subject
        them to reboots.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The list of ZooKeeper servers used by the client must match the
        list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper server has. Things can
        work, although not optimally, if the client list is a subset of the
        real list of ZooKeeper servers, but not if the client lists ZooKeeper
        servers not in the ZooKeeper cluster.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Be careful where you put that transaction log. The most
        performance-critical part of ZooKeeper is the transaction log.
        ZooKeeper must sync transactions to media before it returns a
        response. A dedicated transaction log device is key to consistent good
        performance. Putting the log on a busy device will adversely effect
        performance. If you only have one storage device, put trace files on
        NFS and increase the snapshotCount; it doesn't eliminate the problem,
        but it can mitigate it.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set your Java max heap size correctly. It is very important to
        <emphasis>avoid swapping.</emphasis> Going to disk unnecessarily will
        almost certainly degrade your performance unacceptably. Remember, in
        ZooKeeper, everything is ordered, so if one request hits the disk, all
        other queued requests hit the disk.</para>

        <para>To avoid swapping, try to set the heapsize to the amount of
        physical memory you have, minus the amount needed by the OS and cache.
        The best way to determine an optimal heap size for your configurations
        is to <emphasis>run load tests</emphasis>. If for some reason you
        can't, be conservative in your estimates and choose a number well
        below the limit that would cause your machine to swap. For example, on
        a 4G machine, a 3G heap is a conservative estimate to start
        with.</para>
