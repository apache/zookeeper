    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document is a guide for developers wishing to create
    distributed applications that take advantage of ZooKeeper's coordination
    services. It contains conceptual and practical information.</para>

    <para>The first four sections of this guide present higher level
    discussions of various ZooKeeper concepts. These are necessary both for an
    understanding of how ZooKeeper works as well how to work with it. It does
    not contain source code, but it does assume a familiarity with the
    problems associated with distributed computing. The sections in this first
    group are:</para>

    <para>The book concludes with an <ulink

    useful, ZooKeeper-related information.</para>

    <para>Most of information in this document is written to be accessible as
    stand-alone reference material. However, before starting your first
    ZooKeeper application, you should probably at least read the chaptes on
    the <ulink url="#ch_zkDataModel">ZooKeeper Data Model</ulink> and <ulink
    url="#ch_guideToZkOperations">ZooKeeper Basic Operations</ulink>. Also,
    the <ulink url="#ch_programStructureWithExample">Simple Programmming
    Example</ulink> <emphasis>[tbd]</emphasis> is helpful for understanding the basic
    structure of a ZooKeeper client application.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="ch_zkDataModel">
    <title>The ZooKeeper Data Model</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper has a hierarchal name space, much like a distributed file
    system. The only difference is that each node in the namespace can have
    data associated with it as well as children. It is like having a file
    system that allows a file to also be a directory. Paths to nodes are
    always expressed as canonical, absolute, slash-separated paths; there are
    no relative reference. Any unicode character can be used in a path subject
    to the following constraints:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The null character (\u0000) cannot be part of a path name. (This
        causes problems with the C binding.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The following characters can't be used because they don't
        display well, or render in confusing ways: \u0001 - \u0019 and \u007F
        - \u009F.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The following characters are not allowed: \ud800 -uF8FFF,
        \uFFF0 - uFFFF.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The "." character can be used as part of another name, but "."
        and ".." cannot alone be used to indicate a node along a path,
        because ZooKeeper doesn't use relative paths. The following would be
        invalid: "/a/b/./c" or "/a/b/../c".</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The token "zookeeper" is reserved.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="sc_zkDataModel_znodes">
      <title>ZNodes</title>

      <para>Every node in a ZooKeeper tree is referred to as a
      <emphasis>znode</emphasis>. Znodes maintain a stat structure that
      includes version numbers for data changes, acl changes. The stat
      structure also has timestamps. The version number, together with the
      timestamp, allows ZooKeeper to validate the cache and to coordinate
      updates. Each time a znode's data changes, the version number increases.
      For instance, whenever a client retrieves data, it also receives the
      version of the data. And when a client performs an update or a delete,
      it must supply the version of the data of the znode it is changing. If
      the version it supplies doesn't match the actual version of the data,
      the update will fail. (This behavior can be overridden. For more
      information see... )<emphasis>[tbd...]</emphasis></para>

      <note>
        <para>In distributed application engineering, the word
        <emphasis>node</emphasis> can refer to a generic host machine, a
        server, a member of an ensemble, a client process, etc. In the ZooKeeper
        documentation, <emphasis>znodes</emphasis> refer to the data nodes.
        <emphasis>Servers</emphasis>  refer to machines that make up the
        ZooKeeper service; <emphasis>quorum peers</emphasis> refer to the
        servers that make up an ensemble; client refers to any host or process
        which uses a ZooKeeper service.</para>
      </note>

      <para> A znode is the main abstraction a programmer needs to be aware of. Znodes have
      several characteristics that are worth mentioning here.</para>

      <section id="sc_zkDataMode_watches">
        <title>Watches</title>

        <para>Clients can set watches on znodes. Changes to that znode trigger
        the watch and then clear the watch. When a watch triggers, ZooKeeper
        sends the client a notification. More information about watches can be
        found in the section 
	    <ulink url="#ch_zkWatches">ZooKeeper Watches</ulink>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Data Access</title>

        <para>The data stored at each znode in a namespace is read and written
        atomically. Reads get all the data bytes associated with a znode and a
        write replaces all the data. Each node has an Access Control List
        (ACL) that restricts who can do what.</para>
        
        <para>ZooKeeper was not designed to be a general database or large
        object store. Instead, it manages coordination data. This data can
        come in the form of configuration, status information, rendezvous, etc.
        A common property of the various forms of coordination data is that
        they are relatively small: measured in kilobytes.
        The ZooKeeper client and the server implementations have sanity checks
        to ensure that znodes have less than 1M of data, but the data should
        be much less than that on average. Operating on relatively large data
        sizes will cause some operations to take much more time than others and
        will affect the latencies of some operations because of the extra time
        needed to move more data over the network and onto storage media. If
        large data storage is needed, the usually pattern of dealing with such
        data is to store it on a bulk storage system, such as NFS or HDFS, and
        store pointers to the storage locations in ZooKeeper.</para> 
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Ephemeral Nodes</title>

        <para>ZooKeeper also has the notion of ephemeral nodes. These znodes
        exists as long as the session that created the znode is active. When
        the session ends the znode is deleted. Because of this behavior
        ephemeral znodes are not allowed to have children.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Sequence Nodes -- Unique Naming</title>

        <para>When creating a znode you can also request that
        ZooKeeper append a monotonically increasing counter to the end
        of path. This counter is unique to the parent znode. The
        counter has a format of %010d -- that is 10 digits with 0
        (zero) padding (the counter is formatted in this way to
        simplify sorting), i.e. "&lt;path&gt;0000000001". See
        <ulink url="recipes.html#sc_recipes_Queues">Queue
        Recipe</ulink> for an example use of this feature. Note: the
        counter used to store the next sequence number is a signed int
        (4bytes) maintained by the parent node, the counter will
        overflow when incremented beyond 2147483647 (resulting in a
        name "&lt;path&gt;-2147483647").</para>

          connection timeouts between peers, etc. The tick time is only
          indirectly exposed through the minimum session timeout (2 times the
          tick time); if a client requests a session timeout less than the
          minimum session timeout, the server will tell the client that the
          session timeout is actually the minimum session timeout.</para>

  <section id="ch_zkSessions">
    <title>ZooKeeper Sessions</title>

    <para>A ZooKeeper client establishes a session with the ZooKeeper
    service by creating a handle to the service using a language
    binding. Once created, the handle starts of in the CONNECTING state
    and the client library tries to connect to one of the servers that
    make up the ZooKeeper service at which point it switches to the
    CONNECTED state. During normal operation will be in one of these
    two states. If an unrecoverable error occurs, such as session
    expiration or authentication failure, or if the application explicitly
    closes the handle, the handle will move to the CLOSED state.
    The following figure shows the possible state transitions of a
    ZooKeeper client:</para>
    
    <mediaobject id="fg_states" >
  		<imageobject>
    		<imagedata fileref="images/state_dia.jpg"/>
  		</imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
    
    <para>To create a client session the application code must provide
    a connection string containing a comma separated list of host:port pairs,
    each corresponding to a ZooKeeper server (e.g. "127.0.0.1:4545" or
    "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002"). The ZooKeeper
    client library will pick an arbitrary server and try to connect to
    it. If this connection fails, or if the client becomes
    disconnected from the server for any reason, the client will
    automatically try the next server in the list, until a connection
    is (re-)established.</para>

    <para> <emphasis role="bold">Added in 3.2.0</emphasis>: An
    optional "chroot" suffix may also be appended to the connection
    string. This will run the client commands while interpreting all
    paths relative to this root (similar to the unix chroot
    command). If used the example would look like:
    "127.0.0.1:4545/app/a" or
    "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002/app/a" where the
    client would be rooted at "/app/a" and all paths would be relative
    to this root - ie getting/setting/etc...  "/foo/bar" would result
    in operations being run on "/app/a/foo/bar" (from the server
    perspective). This feature is particularly useful in multi-tenant
    environments where each user of a particular ZooKeeper service
    could be rooted differently. This makes re-use much simpler as
    each user can code his/her application as if it were rooted at
    "/", while actual location (say /app/a) could be determined at
    deployment time.</para>

    <para>When a client gets a handle to the ZooKeeper service,
    ZooKeeper creates a ZooKeeper session, represented as a 64-bit
    number, that it assigns to the client. If the client connects to a
    different ZooKeeper server, it will send the session id as a part
    of the connection handshake.  As a security measure, the server
    creates a password for the session id that any ZooKeeper server
    can validate.The password is sent to the client with the session
    id when the client establishes the session. The client sends this
    password with the session id whenever it reestablishes the session
    with a new server.</para>

    <para>One of the parameters to the ZooKeeper client library call
    to create a ZooKeeper session is the session timeout in
    milliseconds. The client sends a requested timeout, the server
    responds with the timeout that it can give the client. The current
    implementation requires that the timeout be a minimum of 2 times
    the tickTime (as set in the server configuration) and a maximum of
    20 times the tickTime. The ZooKeeper client API allows access to
    the negotiated timeout.</para>

    <para>When a client (session) becomes partitioned from the ZK
    serving cluster it will begin searching the list of servers that
    were specified during session creation. Eventually, when
    connectivity between the client and at least one of the servers is
    re-established, the session will either again transition to the
    "connected" state (if reconnected within the session timeout
    value) or it will transition to the "expired" state (if
    reconnected after the session timeout). It is not advisable to
    create a new session object (a new ZooKeeper.class or zookeeper
    handle in the c binding) for disconnection. The ZK client library
    will handle reconnect for you. In particular we have heuristics
    built into the client library to handle things like "herd effect",
    etc... Only create a new session when you are notified of session
    expiration (mandatory).</para>

    <para>Session expiration is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster
    itself, not by the client. When the ZK client establishes a
    session with the cluster it provides a "timeout" value detailed
    above. This value is used by the cluster to determine when the
    client's session expires. Expirations happens when the cluster
    does not hear from the client within the specified session timeout
    period (i.e. no heartbeat). At session expiration the cluster will
    delete any/all ephemeral nodes owned by that session and
    immediately notify any/all connected clients of the change (anyone
    watching those znodes). At this point the client of the expired
    session is still disconnected from the cluster, it will not be
    notified of the session expiration until/unless it is able to
    re-establish a connection to the cluster. The client will stay in
    disconnected state until the TCP connection is re-established with
    the cluster, at which point the watcher of the expired session
    will receive the "session expired" notification.</para>

    <para>Example state transitions for an expired session as seen by
    the expired session's watcher:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>'connected' : session is established and client
      is communicating with cluster (client/server communication is
      operating properly)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>.... client is partitioned from the
      cluster</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>'disconnected' : client has lost connectivity
      with the cluster</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>.... time elapses, after 'timeout' period the
      cluster expires the session, nothing is seen by client as it is
      disconnected from cluster</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>.... time elapses, the client regains network
      level connectivity with the cluster</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>'expired' : eventually the client reconnects to
      the cluster, it is then notified of the
      expiration</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Another parameter to the ZooKeeper session establishment
    call is the default watcher. Watchers are notified when any state
    change occurs in the client. For example if the client loses
    connectivity to the server the client will be notified, or if the
    client's session expires, etc... This watcher should consider the
    initial state to be disconnected (i.e. before any state changes
    events are sent to the watcher by the client lib). In the case of
    a new connection, the first event sent to the watcher is typically
    the session connection event.</para>

    <para>The session is kept alive by requests sent by the client. If
    the session is idle for a period of time that would timeout the
    session, the client will send a PING request to keep the session
    alive. This PING request not only allows the ZooKeeper server to
    know that the client is still active, but it also allows the
    client to verify that its connection to the ZooKeeper server is
    still active. The timing of the PING is conservative enough to
    ensure reasonable time to detect a dead connection and reconnect
    to a new server.</para>

    <para>
      Once a connection to the server is successfully established
      (connected) there are basically two cases where the client lib generates
      connectionloss (the result code in c binding, exception in Java -- see 
      the API documentation for binding specific details) when either a synchronous or
      asynchronous operation is performed and one of the following holds:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The application calls an operation on a session that is no
      longer alive/valid</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The ZooKeeper client disconnects from a server when there
      are pending operations to that server, i.e., there is a pending asynchronous call.
      </para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para> <emphasis role="bold">Added in 3.2.0 -- SessionMovedException</emphasis>. There is an internal
      exception that is generally not seen by clients called the SessionMovedException.
      This exception occurs because a request was received on a connection for a session
      which has been reestablished on a different server. The normal cause of this error is
      a client that sends a request to a server, but the network packet gets delayed, so
      the client times out and connects to a new server. When the delayed packet arrives at
      the first server, the old server detects that the session has moved, and closes the
      client connection. Clients normally do not see this error since they do not read
      from those old connections. (Old connections are usually closed.) One situation in which this
      condition can be seen is when two clients try to reestablish the same connection using
      a saved session id and password. One of the clients will reestablish the connection
      and the second client will be disconnected (causing the pair to attempt to re-establish
      its connection/session indefinitely).</para>

    <title>ZooKeeper Watches</title>

    <para>All of the read operations in ZooKeeper - <emphasis
    role="bold">getData()</emphasis>, <emphasis
    role="bold">getChildren()</emphasis>, and <emphasis
    role="bold">exists()</emphasis> - have the option of setting a watch as a
    side effect. Here is ZooKeeper's definition of a watch: a watch event is
    one-time trigger, sent to the client that set the watch, which occurs when
    the data for which the watch was set changes. There are three key points
    to consider in this definition of a watch:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">One-time trigger</emphasis></para>

        <para>One watch event will be sent to the client when the data has changed.
        For example, if a client does a getData("/znode1", true) and later the
        data for /znode1 is changed or deleted, the client will get a watch
        event for /znode1. If /znode1 changes again, no watch event will be
        sent unless the client has done another read that sets a new
        watch.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sent to the client</emphasis></para>

        <para>This implies that an event is on the way to the client, but may
        not reach the client before the successful return code to the change
        operation reaches the client that initiated the change. Watches are
        sent asynchronously to watchers. ZooKeeper provides an ordering
        guarantee: a client will never see a change for which it has set a
        watch until it first sees the watch event. Network delays or other
        factors may cause different clients to see watches and return codes
        from updates at different times. The key point is that everything seen
        by the different clients will have a consistent order.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The data for which the watch was
        set</emphasis></para>

        <para>This refers to the different ways a node can change.  It
        helps to think of ZooKeeper as maintaining two lists of
        watches: data watches and child watches.  getData() and
        exists() set data watches. getChildren() sets child
        watches. Alternatively, it may help to think of watches being
        set according to the kind of data returned. getData() and
        exists() return information about the data of the node,
        whereas getChildren() returns a list of children.  Thus,
        setData() will trigger data watches for the znode being set
        (assuming the set is successful). A successful create() will
        trigger a data watch for the znode being created and a child
        watch for the parent znode. A successful delete() will trigger
        both a data watch and a child watch (since there can be no
        more children) for a znode being deleted as well as a child
        watch for the parent znode.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Watches are maintained locally at the ZooKeeper server to which the
    client is connected. This allows watches to be lightweight to set,
    maintain, and dispatch. When a client connects to a new server, the watch
    will be triggered for any session events. Watches will not be received
    while disconnected from a server. When a client reconnects, any previously
    registered watches will be reregistered and triggered if needed. In
    general this all occurs transparently. There is one case where a watch
    may be missed: a watch for the existence of a znode not yet created will
    be missed if the znode is created and deleted while disconnected.</para>

  <section id="sc_ZooKeeperAccessControl">
    <title>ZooKeeper access control using ACLs</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper uses ACLs to control access to its znodes (the
    data nodes of a ZooKeeper data tree). The ACL implementation is
    quite similar to UNIX file access permissions: it employs
    permission bits to allow/disallow various operations against a
    node and the scope to which the bits apply. Unlike standard UNIX
    permissions, a ZooKeeper node is not limited by the three standard
    scopes for user (owner of the file), group, and world
    (other). ZooKeeper does not have a notion of an owner of a
    znode. Instead, an ACL specifies sets of ids and permissions that
    are associated with those ids.</para>

    <para>Note also that an ACL pertains only to a specific znode. In
    particular it does not apply to children. For example, if
    <emphasis>/app</emphasis> is only readable by ip:172.16.16.1 and
    <emphasis>/app/status</emphasis> is world readable, anyone will
    be able to read <emphasis>/app/status</emphasis>; ACLs are not
    recursive.</para>

    <para>ZooKeeper supports pluggable authentication schemes. Ids are
    specified using the form <emphasis>scheme:id</emphasis>,
    where <emphasis>scheme</emphasis> is a the authentication scheme
    that the id corresponds to. For
    example, <emphasis>ip:172.16.16.1</emphasis> is an id for a
    host with the address <emphasis>172.16.16.1</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>When a client connects to ZooKeeper and authenticates
    itself, ZooKeeper associates all the ids that correspond to a
    client with the clients connection. These ids are checked against
    the ACLs of znodes when a clients tries to access a node. ACLs are
    made up of pairs of <emphasis>(scheme:expression,
    perms)</emphasis>. The format of
    the <emphasis>expression</emphasis> is specific to the scheme. For
    example, the pair <emphasis>(ip:19.22.0.0/16, READ)</emphasis>
    gives the <emphasis>READ</emphasis> permission to any clients with
    an IP address that starts with 19.22.</para>

      <title>ACL Permissions</title>

        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">ADMIN</emphasis>: you can set permissions</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis>
      and <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> permissions have been broken out
      of the <emphasis>WRITE</emphasis> permission for finer grained
      access controls. The cases for <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis>
      and <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> are the following:</para>

      <para>You want A to be able to do a set on a ZooKeeper node, but
      not be able to <emphasis>CREATE</emphasis>
      or <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis> children.</para>

      <para><emphasis>CREATE</emphasis>
      without <emphasis>DELETE</emphasis>: clients create requests by
      creating ZooKeeper nodes in a parent directory. You want all
      clients to be able to add, but only request processor can
      delete. (This is kind of like the APPEND permission for
      files.)</para>

      <para>Also, the <emphasis>ADMIN</emphasis> permission is there
      since ZooKeeper doesn’t have a notion of file owner. In some
      sense the <emphasis>ADMIN</emphasis> permission designates the
      entity as the owner. ZooKeeper doesn’t support the LOOKUP
      permission (execute permission bit on directories to allow you
      to LOOKUP even though you can't list the directory). Everyone
      implicitly has LOOKUP permission. This allows you to stat a
      node, but nothing more. (The problem is, if you want to call
      zoo_exists() on a node that doesn't exist, there is no
      permission to check.)</para>

  <section id="sc_ZooKeeperPluggableAuthentication">
    <title>Pluggable ZooKeeper authentication</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper runs in a variety of different environments with
    various different authentication schemes, so it has a completely
    pluggable authentication framework. Even the builtin authentication
    schemes use the pluggable authentication framework.</para>

    <para>To understand how the authentication framework works, first you must
    understand the two main authentication operations. The framework 
    first must authenticate the client. This is usually done as soon as
    the client connects to a server and consists of validating information
    sent from or gathered about a client and associating it with the connection.
    The second operation handled by the framework is finding the entries in an
    ACL that correspond to client. ACL entries are &lt;<emphasis>idspec, 
    permissions</emphasis>&gt; pairs. The <emphasis>idspec</emphasis> may be
    a simple string match against the authentication information associated
    with the connection or it may be a expression that is evaluated against that
    information. It is up to the implementation of the authentication plugin
    to do the match. Here is the interface that an authentication plugin must
    implement:</para>

    <programlisting>
public interface AuthenticationProvider {
    String getScheme();
    KeeperException.Code handleAuthentication(ServerCnxn cnxn, byte authData[]);
    boolean isValid(String id);
    boolean matches(String id, String aclExpr);
    boolean isAuthenticated();
}
    </programlisting>

    <para>The first method <emphasis>getScheme</emphasis> returns the string
    that identifies the plugin. Because we support multiple methods of authentication,
    an authentication credential or an <emphasis>idspec</emphasis> will always be
    prefixed with <emphasis>scheme:</emphasis>. The ZooKeeper server uses the scheme
    returned by the authentication plugin to determine which ids the scheme
    applies to.</para>

    <para><emphasis>handleAuthentication</emphasis> is called when a client
    sends authentication information to be associated with a connection. The
    client specifies the scheme to which the information corresponds. The
    ZooKeeper server passes the information to the authentication plugin whose
    <emphasis>getScheme</emphasis> matches the scheme passed by the client. The
    implementor of <emphasis>handleAuthentication</emphasis> will usually return
    an error if it determines that the information is bad, or it will associate information
    with the connection using <emphasis>cnxn.getAuthInfo().add(new Id(getScheme(), data))</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>The authentication plugin is involved in both setting and using ACLs. When an
    ACL is set for a znode, the ZooKeeper server will pass the id part of the entry to
    the <emphasis>isValid(String id)</emphasis> method. It is up to the plugin to verify
    that the id has a correct form. For example, <emphasis>ip:172.16.0.0/16</emphasis>
    is a valid id, but <emphasis>ip:host.com</emphasis> is not. If the new ACL includes
    an "auth" entry, <emphasis>isAuthenticated</emphasis> is used to see if the 
    authentication information for this scheme that is assocatied with the connection
    should be added to the ACL. Some schemes
    should not be included in auth. For example, the IP address of the client is not
    considered as an id that should be added to the ACL if auth is specified.</para>

    <para>ZooKeeper invokes
    <emphasis>matches(String id, String aclExpr)</emphasis> when checking an ACL. It
    needs to match authentication information of the client against the relevant ACL
    entries. To find the entries which apply to the client, the ZooKeeper server will
    find the scheme of each entry and if there is authentication information
    from that client for that scheme, <emphasis>matches(String id, String aclExpr)</emphasis>
    will be called with <emphasis>id</emphasis> set to the authentication information
    that was previously added to the connection by <emphasis>handleAuthentication</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>aclExpr</emphasis> set to the id of the ACL entry. The authentication plugin
    uses its own logic and matching scheme to determine if <emphasis>id</emphasis> is included
    in <emphasis>aclExpr</emphasis>. 
    </para>

    <para>There are two built in authentication plugins: <emphasis>ip</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>digest</emphasis>. Additional plugins can adding using system properties. At
    startup the ZooKeeper server will look for system properties that start with
    "zookeeper.authProvider." and interpret the value of those properties as the class name
    of an authentication plugin. These properties can be set using the
    <emphasis>-Dzookeeeper.authProvider.X=com.f.MyAuth</emphasis> or adding entries such as
    the following in the server configuration file:</para>

    <programlisting>
authProvider.1=com.f.MyAuth
authProvider.2=com.f.MyAuth2
    </programlisting>
 
    <para>Care should be taking to ensure that the suffix on the property is unique. If there are 
    duplicates such as <emphasis>-Dzookeeeper.authProvider.X=com.f.MyAuth -Dzookeeper.authProvider.X=com.f.MyAuth2</emphasis>,
    only one will be used. Also all servers must have the same plugins defined, otherwise clients using
    the authentication schemes provided by the plugins will have problems connecting to some servers.

    <title>Consistency Guarantees</title>

    <para>ZooKeeper is a high performance, scalable service. Both reads and
    write operations are designed to be fast, though reads are faster than
    writes. The reason for this is that in the case of reads, ZooKeeper can
    serve older data, which in turn is due to ZooKeeper's consistency

            <term>Simultaneously Consistent Cross-Client Views</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>ZooKeeper does not guarantee that at every instance in

              ZooKeeper data. Due to factors like network delays, one client
              may perform an update before another client gets notified of the
              change. Consider the scenario of two clients, A and B. If client
              A sets the value of a znode /a from 0 to 1, then tells client B
              to read /a, client B may read the old value of 0, depending on
              which server it is connected to. If it
              is important that Client A and Client B read the same value,
              Client B should should call the <emphasis

  <section id="ch_bindings">
    <title>Bindings</title>

    <para>The ZooKeeper client libraries come in two languages: Java and C.
    The following sections describe these.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Java Binding</title>

      <para>There are two packages that make up the ZooKeeper Java binding:
      <emphasis role="bold">org.apache.zookeeper</emphasis> and <emphasis
      role="bold">org.apache.zookeeper.data</emphasis>. The rest of the
      packages that make up ZooKeeper are used internally or are part of the
      server implementation. The <emphasis
      role="bold">org.apache.zookeeper.data</emphasis> package is made up of
      generated classes that are used simply as containers.</para>

      <para>The main class used by a ZooKeeper Java client is the <emphasis
      role="bold">ZooKeeper</emphasis> class. Its two constructors differ only
      by an optional session id and password. ZooKeeper supports session
      recovery accross instances of a process. A Java program may save its
      session id and password to stable storage, restart, and recover the
      session that was used by the earlier instance of the program.</para>

      <para>When a ZooKeeper object is created, two threads are created as
      well: an IO thread and an event thread. All IO happens on the IO thread
      (using Java NIO). All event callbacks happen on the event thread.
      Session maintenance such as reconnecting to ZooKeeper servers and
      maintaining heartbeat is done on the IO thread. Responses for
      synchronous methods are also processed in the IO thread. All responses
      to asynchronous methods and watch events are processed on the event
      thread. There are a few things to notice that result from this
      design:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All completions for asynchronous calls and watcher callbacks
          will be made in order, one at a time. The caller can do any
          processing they wish, but no other callbacks will be processed
          during that time.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Callbacks do not block the processing of the IO thread or the
          processing of the synchronous calls.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Synchronous calls may not return in the correct order. For
          example, assume a client does the following processing: issues an
          asynchronous read of node <emphasis role="bold">/a</emphasis> with
          <emphasis>watch</emphasis> set to true, and then in the completion
          callback of the read it does a synchronous read of <emphasis
          role="bold">/a</emphasis>. (Maybe not good practice, but not illegal
          either, and it makes for a simple example.)</para>

          <para>Note that if there is a change to <emphasis
          role="bold">/a</emphasis> between the asynchronous read and the
          synchronous read, the client library will receive the watch event
          saying <emphasis role="bold">/a</emphasis> changed before the
          response for the synchronous read, but because the completion
          callback is blocking the event queue, the synchronous read will
          return with the new value of <emphasis role="bold">/a</emphasis>
          before the watch event is processed.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Finally, the rules associated with shutdown are straightforward:
      once a ZooKeeper object is closed or receives a fatal event
      (SESSION_EXPIRED and AUTH_FAILED), the ZooKeeper object becomes invalid.
      On a close, the two threads shut down and any further access on zookeeper
      handle is undefined behavior and should be avoided. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>C Binding</title>

      <para>The C binding has a single-threaded and multi-threaded library.
      The multi-threaded library is easiest to use and is most similar to the
      Java API. This library will create an IO thread and an event dispatch
      thread for handling connection maintenance and callbacks. The
      single-threaded library allows ZooKeeper to be used in event driven
      applications by exposing the event loop used in the multi-threaded
      library.</para>

      <para>The package includes two shared libraries: zookeeper_st and
      zookeeper_mt. The former only provides the asynchronous APIs and
      callbacks for integrating into the application's event loop. The only
      reason this library exists is to support the platforms were a
      <emphasis>pthread</emphasis> library is not available or is unstable
      (i.e. FreeBSD 4.x). In all other cases, application developers should
      link with zookeeper_mt, as it includes support for both Sync and Async
      API.</para>

        <title>Installation</title>

    <para>So now you know ZooKeeper. It's fast, simple, your application
    works, but wait ... something's wrong. Here are some pitfalls that
    ZooKeeper users fall into:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you are using watches, you must look for the connected watch
        event. When a ZooKeeper client disconnects from a server, you will
        not receive notification of changes until reconnected. If you are
        watching for a znode to come into existence, you will miss the event
        if the znode is created and deleted while you are disconnected.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You must test ZooKeeper server failures. The ZooKeeper service
        can survive failures as long as a majority of servers are active. The
        question to ask is: can your application handle it? In the real world
        a client's connection to ZooKeeper can break. (ZooKeeper server
        failures and network partitions are common reasons for connection
        loss.) The ZooKeeper client library takes care of recovering your
        connection and letting you know what happened, but you must make sure
        that you recover your state and any outstanding requests that failed.
        Find out if you got it right in the test lab, not in production - test
        with a ZooKeeper service made up of a several of servers and subject
        them to reboots.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The list of ZooKeeper servers used by the client must match the
        list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper server has. Things can
        work, although not optimally, if the client list is a subset of the
        real list of ZooKeeper servers, but not if the client lists ZooKeeper

        <para>Be careful where you put that transaction log. The most
        performance-critical part of ZooKeeper is the transaction log.
        ZooKeeper must sync transactions to media before it returns a
        response. A dedicated transaction log device is key to consistent good
        performance. Putting the log on a busy device will adversely effect
        performance. If you only have one storage device, put trace files on
        NFS and increase the snapshotCount; it doesn't eliminate the problem,
        but it can mitigate it.</para>

        <para>Set your Java max heap size correctly. It is very important to
        <emphasis>avoid swapping.</emphasis> Going to disk unnecessarily will
        almost certainly degrade your performance unacceptably. Remember, in
        ZooKeeper, everything is ordered, so if one request hits the disk, all
        other queued requests hit the disk.</para>

        <para>To avoid swapping, try to set the heapsize to the amount of
        physical memory you have, minus the amount needed by the OS and cache.
        The best way to determine an optimal heap size for your configurations
        is to <emphasis>run load tests</emphasis>. If for some reason you
        can't, be conservative in your estimates and choose a number well
        below the limit that would cause your machine to swap. For example, on
        a 4G machine, a 3G heap is a conservative estimate to start
        with.</para>
