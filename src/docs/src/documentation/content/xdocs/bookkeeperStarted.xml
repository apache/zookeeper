    <abstract>
      <para>This guide contains detailed information about using BookKeeper
      for logging. It discusses the basic operations BookKeeper supports, 
      and how to create logs and perform basic read and write operations on these
      logs.</para>

    <title>Getting Started: Setting up BookKeeper to write logs.</title>

    <para>This document contains information to get you started quickly with
    BookKeeper. It is aimed primarily at developers willing to try it out, and
    contains simple installation instructions for a simple BookKeeper installation
    and a simple programming example. For further programming detail, please refer to

		<para> BookKeeper is distributed along with ZooKeeper. To get a ZooKeeper distribution,

		<para> Under org.apache.bookkeeper.util, you'll find a java program
		called LocalBookKeeper.java that sets you up to run BookKeeper on a 
		single machine. This is far from ideal from a performance perspective,
		but the program is useful for both test and educational purposes.

		<para> If you're bold and you want more than just running things locally, then
		you'll need to run bookies in different servers. You'll need at least three bookies
		to start with.

		For each bookie, we need to execute a command like the following:

		/path_to_ledger_device/
		</computeroutput></para>
		
		<para> "/path_to_log_device/" and "/path_to_ledger_device/" are different paths. Also, port 3181

	  	<title>Setting up ZooKeeper</title>
	  	<para> ZooKeeper stores metadata on behalf of BookKeeper clients and bookies. To get a minimal 
	  	ZooKeeper installation to work with BookKeeper, we can set up one server running in
	  	standalone mode. Once we have the server running, we need to create a few znodes:

	  	<para> For each bookie, we add one znode such that the name of the znode is the
	  	concatenation of the machine name and the port number that the bookie is 
	  	listening on. For example, if a bookie is running on bookie.foo.com an is listening 
	  	on port 3181, we add a znode
