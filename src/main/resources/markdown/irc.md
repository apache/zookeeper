# ZooKeeper IRC Channel

There is an IRC channel dedicated to zookeeper at irc.freenode.org. The name of the channel is #zookeeper.

The IRC channel can be used for online discussion about zookeeper related stuff, but developers
should be careful to transfer all the official decisions or useful discussions to the issue tracking system.
