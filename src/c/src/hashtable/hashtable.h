/* Macros may be used to define type-safe(r) hashtable access functions, with
 * methods specialized to take known key and value types as parameters.
 * 
 * Example:
 *
 * Insert this at the start of your file:
 *
 * DEFINE_HASHTABLE_INSERT(insert_some, struct some_key, struct some_value);
 * DEFINE_HASHTABLE_SEARCH(search_some, struct some_key, struct some_value);
 * DEFINE_HASHTABLE_REMOVE(remove_some, struct some_key, struct some_value);
 *
 * This defines the functions 'insert_some', 'search_some' and 'remove_some'.
 * These operate just like hashtable_insert etc., with the same parameters,
 * but their function signatures have 'struct some_key *' rather than
 * 'void *', and hence can generate compile time errors if your program is
 * supplying incorrect data as a key (and similarly for value).
 *
 * Note that the hash and key equality functions passed to create_hashtable
 * still take 'void *' parameters instead of 'some key *'. This shouldn't be
 * a difficult issue as they're only defined and passed once, and the other
 * functions will ensure that only valid keys are supplied to them.
 *
 * The cost for this checking is increased code size and runtime overhead
 * - if performance is important, it may be worth switching back to the
 * unsafe methods once your program has been debugged with the safe methods.
 * This just requires switching to some simple alternative defines - eg:
 * #define insert_some hashtable_insert
 *
