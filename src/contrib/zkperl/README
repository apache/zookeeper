Net::ZooKeeper - Perl extension for Apache ZooKeeper
====================================================

Net::ZooKeeper provides a Perl interface to the synchronous C API
of Apache ZooKeeper.  ZooKeeper is coordination service for
distributed applications and is a sub-project of the Apache Hadoop
project.  For details see the ZooKeeper home page at:

http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL \
        --zookeeper-include=/path/to/zookeeper/client/include \
        --zookeeper-lib=/path/to/zookeeper/client/lib
    make
    ZK_TEST_HOSTS=host:port,... make test
    make install

The path supplied to the --zookeeper-include option should
identify the directory that contains the zookeeper.h and other
ZooKeeper C include files.

The path supplied to the --zookeeper-lib option should identify
the directory that contains the libzookeeper_mt library.

When running "make test", if no ZK_TEST_HOSTS environment
variable is set, many tests will be skipped because no connection
to a ZooKeeper server is available.  To execute these tests,
the ZK_TEST_HOSTS variable may be assigned a list of one or more
ZooKeeper host:port pairs, e.g., "localhost:7100,otherhost:7200".

The ZK_TEST_PATH environment variable, if defined, specifies
the ZooKeeper path under which all test nodes should be created.
The tests expect to have full read/write/create/delete/admin
ZooKeeper permissions under this path.  If no ZK_TEST_PATH
variable is defined, the root ZooKeeper path ("/") is used.

DEPENDENCIES

Version 3.1.1 of ZooKeeper is required at a minimum.

For version 3.1.1, you may also want to apply some of these
additional patches to the ZooKeeper C API code:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-262
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-318

For version 3.1.1, you may also want to apply some of these
additional patches to the ZooKeeper C API code:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-262
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-466

This module requires that the multi-threaded version of the
ZooKeeper C API client library be available on your system.

This in turn implies that the POSIX pthread library is available
as well.
