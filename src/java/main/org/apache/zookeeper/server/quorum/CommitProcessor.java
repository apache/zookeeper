/**
 * This RequestProcessor matches the incoming committed requests with the
 * locally submitted requests. The trick is that locally submitted requests that
 * change the state of the system will come back as incoming committed requests,
 * so we need to match them up. Instead of just waiting for the committed requests, 
 * we process the uncommitted requests that belong to other sessions.
 *
 * The CommitProcessor is multi-threaded. Communication between threads is
 * handled via queues, atomics, and wait/notifyAll synchronized on the
 * processor. The CommitProcessor acts as a gateway for allowing requests to
 * continue with the remainder of the processing pipeline. It will allow many
 * read requests but only a single write request to be in flight simultaneously,
 * thus ensuring that write requests are processed in transaction id order.
 *
 *   - 1   commit processor main thread, which watches the request queues and
 *         assigns requests to worker threads based on their sessionId so that
 *         read and write requests for a particular session are always assigned
 *         to the same thread (and hence are guaranteed to run in order).
 *   - 0-N worker threads, which run the rest of the request processor pipeline
 *         on the requests. If configured with 0 worker threads, the primary
 *         commit processor thread runs the pipeline directly.
 *
 * Typical (default) thread counts are: on a 32 core machine, 1 commit
 * processor thread and 32 worker threads.
 *
 * Multi-threading constraints:
 *   - Each session's requests must be processed in order.
 *   - Write requests must be processed in zxid order
 *   - Must ensure no race condition between writes in one session that would
 *     trigger a watch being set by a read request in another session
 *
 * The current implementation solves the third constraint by simply allowing no
 * read requests to be processed in parallel with write requests.
