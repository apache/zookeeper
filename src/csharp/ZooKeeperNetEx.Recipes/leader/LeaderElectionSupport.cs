    ///         This support library is meant to simplify the construction of an exclusive
    ///         leader system on top of Apache ZooKeeper. Any application that can become the
    ///         leader (usually a process that provides a service, exclusively) would
    ///         configure an instance of this class with their hostname, at least one
    ///         listener (an implementation of <seealso cref="LeaderElectionAware" />), and either an
    ///         instance of <seealso cref="ZooKeeper" /> or the proper connection information. Once
    ///         configured, invoking <seealso cref="start()" /> will cause the client to connect to
    ///         ZooKeeper and create a leader offer. The library then determines if it has
    ///         been elected the leader using the algorithm described below. The client
    ///         application can follow all state transitions via the listener callback.

    ///         start and a state complete event are sent to all listeners. When
    ///         <seealso cref="start()" /> is called, a leader offer is created in ZooKeeper. A leader
    ///         offer is an ephemeral sequential node that indicates a process that can act
    ///         as a leader for this service. A read of all leader offers is then performed.
    ///         The offer with the lowest sequence number is said to be the leader. The
    ///         process elected leader will transition to the leader state. All other
    ///         processes will transition to a ready state. Internally, the library creates a
    ///         ZooKeeper watch on the leader offer with the sequence ID of N - 1 (where N is
    ///         the process's sequence ID). If that offer disappears due to a process
    ///         failure, the watching process will run through the election determination
    ///         process again to see if it should become the leader. Note that sequence ID
