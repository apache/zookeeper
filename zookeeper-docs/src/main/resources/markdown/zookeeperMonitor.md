## New Metrics System
The feature:`New Metrics System` has been available since 3.6.0 which provides the abundant metrics
to help users monitor the ZooKeeper on the topic: znode, network, disk, quorum, leader election,
client, security, failures, watch/session, requestProcessor, and so forth.

### Metrics
All the metrics are included in the `ServerMetrics.java`.

<a name="Prometheus"></a>

### Prometheus
- Running a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring service is the easiest way to ingest and record ZooKeeper's metrics.
- Pre-requisites:
  - enable the `Prometheus MetricsProvider` by setting `metricsProvider.className=org.apache.zookeeper.metrics.prometheus.PrometheusMetricsProvider` in the zoo.cfg.
  - the Port is also configurable by setting `metricsProvider.httpPort`（the default value:7000）
- Install Prometheus:
  Go to the official website download [page](https://prometheus.io/download/), download the latest release.
  
- Set Prometheus's scraper to target the ZooKeeper cluster endpoints:

    ```bash
    cat > /tmp/test-zk.yaml <<EOF
    global:
      scrape_interval: 10s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: test-zk
        static_configs:
        - targets: ['192.168.10.32:7000','192.168.10.33:7000','192.168.10.34:7000']
    EOF
    cat /tmp/test-zk.yaml
    ```

- Set up the Prometheus handler:

    ```bash
    nohup /tmp/prometheus \
        --config.file /tmp/test-zk.yaml \
        --web.listen-address ":9090" \
        --storage.tsdb.path "/tmp/test-zk.data" >> /tmp/test-zk.log  2>&1 &
    ```

- Now Prometheus will scrape zk metrics every 10 seconds.

### Alerting with Prometheus
- We recommend that you read [Prometheus Official Alerting Page](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/alerting/) to explore
  some principles of alerting

- We recommend that you use [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://www.prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) which can
  help users to receive alerting email or instant message(by webhook) in a more convenient way

- We provide an alerting example where these metrics should be taken a special attention. Note: this is for your reference only,
  and you need to adjust them according to your actual situation and resource environment


        use ./promtool check rules rules/zk.yml to check the correctness of the config file
        cat rules/zk.yml

        groups:
        - name: zk-alert-example
          rules:

<a name="Grafana"></a>

### Grafana
- Grafana has built-in Prometheus support; just add a Prometheus data source:

    ```bash
    Name:   test-zk
    Type:   Prometheus
    Url:    http://localhost:9090
    Access: proxy
    ```
- Then download and import the default ZooKeeper dashboard [template](https://grafana.com/dashboards/10465) and customize.
- Users can ask for Grafana dashboard account if having any good improvements by writing a email to **dev@zookeeper.apache.org**.

### InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open source time series data that is often used to store metrics
from Zookeeper. You can [download](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/) the
open source version or create a [free](https://cloud2.influxdata.com/signup)
account on InfluxDB Cloud. In either case, configure the [Apache Zookeeper
Telegraf plugin](https://www.influxdata.com/integration/apache-zookeeper/) to
start collecting and storing metrics from your Zookeeper clusters into your
InfluxDB instance. There is also an [Apache Zookeeper InfluxDB
template](https://www.influxdata.com/influxdb-templates/zookeeper-monitor/) that
includes the Telegraf configurations and a dashboard to get you set up right
away.
