# Release Notes - ZooKeeper - Version 3.8.5

## Breaking changes
[ZOOKEEPER-4891](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-4891) updates `logback-classic` to `1.3.15` to solve cve issues and
`slf4j-api` to `2.0.13` to meet compatibilty requirement of logback.

This could cause slf4j to complain "No SLF4J providers were found" and output no further logs in certain conditions.
1. For library or client usage, this could happen if you specify and inherit incompatible slf4j and logback versions, say, `slf4j-api:2.0.13` from
   `org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper` and `logback-classic:1.2.13` from customized project dependencies.
2. For application or deployment usage, this could happen if you custom and inherit incompatible slf4j and logback versions in classpath, say,
   `slf4j-api:2.0.13` from zookeeper distribution and `logback-classic:1.2.13` from customization.

This could be solved by specifying compatiable slf4j and logback versions in classpath, say, `slf4j-api:2.0.13` and `logback-classic:1.3.15`.
