    <title>ZooKeeper: Because Coordinating Distributed Systems is a Zoo</title>
  </header>
  
  <body>
    <p>ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for
      distributed applications.  It exposes common services - such as
      naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group
      services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them
      from scratch.  You can use it off-the-shelf to implement
      consensus, group management, leader election, and presence
      protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following documents describe concepts and procedures to get
      you started using ZooKeeper. If you have more questions, please
      ask the <a href="ext:lists">mailing list</a> or browse the
