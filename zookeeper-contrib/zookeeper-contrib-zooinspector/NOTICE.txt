The icons in src/main/resources/icons are taken from the Tango project
downloaded from http://tango.freedesktop.org/releases on 2011-09-06.
The Tango project is public domain.

Distribution packagers should not include the icons in the package but rather depend on tango-icon-theme (Debian package name). ZooInspector will then try to get the icons from /usr/share/icons/Tango rather then from its jar file.
