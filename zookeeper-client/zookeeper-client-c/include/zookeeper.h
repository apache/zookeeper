/**
 * \file zookeeper.h
 * \brief ZooKeeper functions and definitions.
 *
 * ZooKeeper is a network service that may be backed by a cluster of
 * synchronized servers. The data in the service is represented as a tree
 * of data nodes. Each node has data, children, an ACL, and status information.
 * The data for a node is read and write in its entirety.
 *
 * ZooKeeper clients can leave watches when they queries the data or children
 * of a node. If a watch is left, that client will be notified of the change.
 * The notification is a one time trigger. Subsequent chances to the node will
 * not trigger a notification unless the client issues a query with the watch
 * flag set. If the client is ever disconnected from the service, the watches do
 * not need to be reset. The client automatically resets the watches.
 *
 * When a node is created, it may be flagged as an ephemeral node. Ephemeral
 * nodes are automatically removed when a client session is closed or when
 * a session times out due to inactivity (the ZooKeeper runtime fills in
 * periods of inactivity with pings). Ephemeral nodes cannot have children.
 *
 * ZooKeeper clients are identified by a server assigned session id. For
 * security reasons The server
 * also generates a corresponding password for a session. A client may save its
 * id and corresponding password to persistent storage in order to use the
 * session across program invocation boundaries.

 *
 * This function invokes a probabilistic load-balancing algorithm which may cause
 * the client to disconnect from its current host to achieve expected uniform
 * connections per server in the new list. In case the current host to which the
 * client is connected is not in the new list this call will always cause the
 * connection to be dropped. Otherwise, the decision is based on whether the
 * number of servers has increased or decreased and by how much.
 *
 * If the connection is dropped, the client moves to a special "reconfig" mode
 * where he chooses a new server to connect to using the probabilistic algorithm.
 * After finding a server or exhaustively trying all the servers in the new list,
 * the client moves back to the normal mode of operation where it will pick an
